//! The CDR's **FHIR connector** surface the console consumes.
//!
//! The availability probe the whole screen and its nav entry are gated on, the
//! five mapping-store operations (list / create / read-by-id / update /
//! delete), the patient-scoped read facade, and the validate-only dry run.
//!
//! NOTE: no openEHR spec governs FHIR interop — our own extension; the external
//! standard is HL7 FHIR R4 (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/>), and the whole group
//! (paths, payloads, status codes) is the CDR's own design.
//!
//! **The console never commits a FHIR resource.** `POST /fhir/r4/{type}` is the
//! connector's real inbound door — it maps, validates and COMMITS — and it has
//! no console path at all. Verification here is read-only in effect: the read
//! facade shows what a stored mapping produces on read, and the dry run
//! (`POST /fhir/r4/{type}/$validate`) reports the verdict the ingest door would
//! reach while committing nothing.
//!
//! **Probe-and-hide.** The group is config-gated on the CDR (`[fhir]
//! api_enabled`, off by default) and answers `404` for every route as if
//! unmounted while it is off, so the console discovers it
//! ([`probe_fhir_connector`]) before offering any of it — the same
//! discover-and-hide pattern as [`crate::admin`], [`crate::management`] and
//! [`crate::tenants`]. Capability is not authorization: a mounted-but-refused
//! group (`401`/`403`) still counts as present, and the refusal surfaces as
//! copy on the screen that asked.
//!
//! **Two error vocabularies meet on this surface, and ONE reader speaks
//! both (#2581).** Every refusal the connector itself authors is a FHIR
//! `OperationOutcome` (`{resourceType, issue: [{severity, code,
//! diagnostics}]}`); authentication and authorization refusals come from the
//! layer ABOVE the handler and carry the openEHR `{error, message}` body.
//! The shared reader ([`crate::cdr`]'s `expect_success`) extracts the human
//! diagnostic from either shape, so this module keeps no refusal shim;
//! [`outcome_summary`] remains for the VERDICT panel, which classifies
//! outcomes rather than reading refusals.
//!
//! Every `#[server]` fn guards with
//! [`require_session`](crate::session::require_session) first (a server fn is a
//! publicly reachable HTTP endpoint — rules §0) and keeps the CDR credential
//! server-side.
