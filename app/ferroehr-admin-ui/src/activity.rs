//! Activity timelines: the pure day-bucketing every activity chart in the
//! console derives its points from.
//!
//! Kept out of the components (and out of the `#[server]` bodies) on purpose —
//! business logic lives in plain, unit-tested Rust and the views stay thin. It
//! is also a pure, deterministic function of its input: no clock, no locale,
//! no network, so a chart derived from it renders identically on the server
//! pass and after hydration.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs an admin UI — our own design / product extension.
//! The timestamps it buckets ARE spec-bound: `AUDIT_DETAILS.time_committed`
//! is a `DV_DATE_TIME` in extended ISO 8601
//! (`docs/specs/openehr/RM/docs/UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.common.audit_details.adoc`),
//! whose first ten characters are the `YYYY-MM-DD` calendar day.
