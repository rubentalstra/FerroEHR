//! The CDR's **event-subscription** surface the console consumes.
//!
//! The availability probe the subscriptions screen and its nav entry are gated
//! on, and the four operations the screen drives over
//! `admin/event_subscription` (list / create / update / delete). The group's
//! read-by-id has no reader here on purpose: the listing already carries every
//! field the screen shows, and a second GET for the same claim is exactly what
//! the one-reader-per-claim rule forbids.
//!
//! NOTE: no openEHR spec governs eventing — our own enterprise extension; the
//! whole group (paths, payloads, status codes) is the CDR's own design.
//!
//! A subscription is a flat predicate record — `kind` / `change_type` /
//! `template_id`, each absent value meaning "any" — plus a name
//! and an `enabled` flag, so the screen edits it with ordinary form fields
//! rather than a document editor.
//!
//! **The console never renders a broker binding key.** Which queue an enabled
//! subscription binds, and how a wildcard predicate is spelled in a topic key,
//! is the CDR publisher's grammar; restating it here would be a second copy of
//! a grammar this crate cannot import (it may depend only on `crates/openehr-*`
//! and the network), free to drift from what the server actually binds. The
//! screen therefore states the predicates in plain words.
//!
//! **Probe-and-hide.** The group is config-gated on the CDR (`[events]
//! admin_api`, off by default) and answers `404` for every route as if
//! unmounted while it is off, so the console discovers it
//! ([`probe_event_subscriptions`]) before offering any of it — the same
//! discover-and-hide pattern as [`crate::admin`], [`crate::management`] and
//! [`crate::tenants`]. Capability is not authorization: a mounted-but-refused
//! group (`401`/`403`) still counts as present, and the refusal surfaces as
//! copy on the screen that asked.
//!
//! Every `#[server]` fn guards with
//! [`require_session`](crate::session::require_session) first (a server fn is a
//! publicly reachable HTTP endpoint — rules §0) and keeps the CDR credential
//! server-side.
