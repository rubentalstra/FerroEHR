//! The `/demographics` section — the CDR's demographic space.
//!
//! Five screens over one API group: the per-kind party browser
//! ([`browse`]), the party detail with its edit / history / relationships /
//! tags tabs ([`party`], [`history`], [`relationship`], [`tags`]), the
//! `PARTY_RELATIONSHIP` resource ([`relationship`]), and the demographic
//! CONTRIBUTION viewer ([`contribution`]).
//!
//! NOTE: the Demographic API is `DEVELOPMENT`-state within ITS-REST
//! Release-1.1.0 (`specifications/docs/demographic/Description.md` §Status),
//! so the wire these screens read can change in the next release.
//!
//! Three wire facts shape every screen here, all verified against the vendored
//! release:
//!
//! 1. **A party is reached by id, never by listing.** The released Demographic
//!    API publishes `POST /demographic/{kind}` plus
//!    `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /demographic/{kind}/{uid_based_id}` and no collection
//!    `GET` (`specifications/demographic.openapi.yaml` + the per-kind
//!    `operations/person_*.yaml` quintet), and AQL's `FROM` is EHR-scoped, so
//!    there is no query that enumerates parties either. The browser screen is
//!    therefore a lookup + create surface, and the one enumerable demographic
//!    collection the release does publish — `GET /demographic/tags`
//!    (`operations/demographic_tags_get.yaml`) — is its listing.
//! 2. **`uid_based_id` has two forms and they are not interchangeable.** An
//!    update addresses the version CONTAINER ("can take only a form of an
//!    `HIER_OBJECT_ID` identifier", `operations/person_update.yaml`), a delete
//!    addresses the version to supersede ("MUST be in a form of an
//!    `OBJECT_VERSION_ID` … representing the `preceding_version_uid` to be
//!    deleted", `operations/person_delete.yaml`), and a read takes either. The
//!    console routes on the container uid ([`container_uid_of`]) and takes the
//!    served document's own `uid.value` for `If-Match` and for the delete path.
//! 3. **`PARTY_RELATIONSHIP` has no released wire.** The vendored Demographic
//!    API defines no `party_relationship` path at all; those routes are the
//!    CDR's own extension realizing SM `I_PARTY_RELATIONSHIP`
//!    (`docs/specs/openehr/SM/docs/UML/classes/i_party_relationship.adoc`), and
//!    a CDR that does not serve them answers `404` — which this section reports
//!    inline rather than hiding.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs an admin UI — our own design / product extension.
//! Every co-located `#[server]` fn guards with
//! [`require_session`](crate::session::require_session) first (rules §0), and
//! the CDR credential never reaches client-visible state.
