//! The `/demographics/{kind}/{uid}` screen — one party, read, edited, walked
//! version by version, related, and tagged.
//!
//! Four URL-driven tabs (`?tab=`, rules §9) over one versioned object:
//!
//! - **Party** (default) — the CURRENT version
//!   (`GET /demographic/{kind}/{uid_based_id}`): its facts, the [`edit_form`]
//!   that commits a new version (`PUT` with `If-Match`), and the whole document
//!   in a [`DocumentPane`](crate::components::format_view::DocumentPane).
//! - **History** — the `VERSIONED_PARTY` family
//!   ([`history`](super::history)).
//! - **Relationships** — the party's own `relationships` list
//!   ([`relationship`](super::relationship)).
//! - **Tags** — its `ITEM_TAG`s ([`tags`](super::tags)).
//!
//! One reader per claim (crate `CLAUDE.md`): the Party tab is the console's ONE
//! reader of the current party document (and the edit form's merge base); the
//! History tab never touches that route — it reads the versioned family for the
//! container + envelope facts and pins a document by an explicit
//! `OBJECT_VERSION_ID`.
//!
//! The edit form replaces exactly `identities` and `details` and re-sends
//! everything else verbatim — never a re-model of the served document. Those
//! two are the party's content: `identities` is RM-mandatory (`PARTY`
//! invariant `Identities_valid`: "not `identities.is_empty`") and `details` is
//! "all other details for this Party"
//! (`docs/specs/openehr/RM/docs/UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.demographic.party.adoc`).
//! `name` is deliberately NOT editable: on a `PARTY` it carries the party TYPE
//! (`Type_valid`: "type = name", and `type()` is "Taken from inherited `_name_`
//! attribute"), not a person's name.
