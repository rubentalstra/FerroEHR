//! The EHR-side `ITEM_TAG` surfaces: the per-target tag panels the composition
//! viewer and the EHR-status tab mount, and the EHR-wide tag browser.
//!
//! Seven released operations, all in the EHR API
//! (`docs/specs/openehr/ITS-REST/specifications/ehr.openapi.yaml`): the
//! aggregate `ehr_tags_get`, and the `composition_tags_*` /
//! `ehr_status_tags_*` get-update-delete trios. There is no directory tag
//! route — a FOLDER's tags are written with the `openehr-item-tag` commit
//! headers instead (`specifications/docs/overview/Requests_and_responses.md`
//! §`openehr-item-tag and openehr-version-item-tag`) — but the aggregate list
//! still reports them, so the browser resolves and links a directory target
//! without offering to edit it.
//!
//! Four wire facts this module is built around, each verified against the
//! released operation files:
//!
//! 1. **No tag route is conditional.** The three write operations declare
//!    `Prefer` and the two content headers and NOTHING else — no `If-Match` —
//!    and a tag collection carries neither `ETag` nor `Last-Modified`, which
//!    `Requests_and_responses.md` §"`ETag` and `Last-Modified`" reserves for
//!    resources "that have versioning or unique state identifiers". A tag write
//!    is therefore last-writer-wins and commits no CONTRIBUTION; every panel
//!    says so rather than implying a safety it does not have.
//! 2. **The container form and the VERSION form address DISJOINT collections.**
//!    A `uid_based_id` is "an `OBJECT_VERSION_ID` … used to get the tags of a
//!    particular (target) version … whereas the latter … is be used to get the
//!    tags of the target `VERSIONED_COMPOSITION` container"
//!    (`operations/composition_tags_get.yaml`), and an `ITEM_TAG` has exactly
//!    one `target` (RM
//!    `docs/specs/openehr/RM/docs/UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.common.item_tag.adoc`)
//!    — so neither collection is a view of the other.
//! 3. **An aggregate tag row names its target but not its target's KIND.** The
//!    RM types `target` as a bare `UID_BASED_ID`, which carries no `type`
//!    member, so opening a row asks the CDR which object holds that id
//!    ([`resolve_ehr_target`]) exactly as the demographic tag index does.
//! 4. **`GET /ehr/{ehr_id}/tags` filters, and an empty answer is `200 []`.**
//!    "This list can be filtered by the given one or more `tag_key`,
//!    `tag_value`, `tag_target_path` query parameters … This will return an
//!    empty list when there is no matching `ITEM_TAG`"
//!    (`operations/ehr_tags_get.yaml`); a `404` means the EHR itself is unknown.
//!
//! The row type, the wire codec, the merge, the editor panel and the filter
//! form are the shared kit ([`crate::components::item_tags`]) — the same one
//! the demographic tag surfaces use.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs an admin UI — our own design / product extension.
//! Every `#[server]` fn below guards with
//! [`require_session`](crate::session::require_session) first (rules §0), the
//! CDR credential never reaches client-visible state, and every path segment is
//! percent-encoded server-side.
