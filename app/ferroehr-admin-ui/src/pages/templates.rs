//! The `/templates` screen — the Template Manager list + template upload.
//!
//! One screen, two template FAMILIES, switched by `?family=` (rules §9 — the
//! switch is deep-linkable URL state, not a private signal): ADL 1.4
//! operational templates (`definition/template/adl1.4`, OPT/XML upload) and
//! ADL2 ones (`definition/template/adl2`, `text/plain` ADL2 source upload).
//! Each family has its own list, its own upload affordance, and its own detail
//! route; the client-side text filter and the URL page window serve both. No
//! openEHR spec governs an admin UI — our own design / product extension; the
//! wire it reads/writes is the ITS-REST Definition API.
//!
//! Discipline (rules §0/§1/§6/§8/§9): every `#[server]` fn guards the session
//! first (a server fn is a public HTTP endpoint) and never lets a CDR
//! credential reach client-visible state; the view is composed from
//! `.into_any()`-erased section locals; async is a [`Resource`] read under
//! `<Transition>` and an [`Action`] per mutating upload (refetch the list on
//! the action's version); the table is the shared [`table_shell`], which emits
//! an explicit `<tbody>` (hydration correctness — rules §8), paged by the
//! shared [`table_footer`] whose page state lives in the URL.
