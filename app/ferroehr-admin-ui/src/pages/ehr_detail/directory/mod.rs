//! The EHR-detail Directory tab.
//!
//! A complete directory experience over the ITS-REST DIRECTORY API — a
//! structured `FOLDER` tree editor (add / rename / delete folders, add /
//! remove item references), an advanced raw-JSON mode, version history with
//! time-travel and restore, a `version_at_time` view, a `?path=` subtree
//! query, and directory deletion — plus the create-empty path for an EHR that
//! has no directory yet.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs an admin UI (our own design / product extension);
//! the wire it reads/writes IS spec-bound: the DIRECTORY operations
//! (ITS-REST `specifications/operations/directory_*.yaml`), the `FOLDER`
//! schema (`specifications/schemas/ehr/Folder.yaml`), and RM common
//! `master05-directory_package`. Every `#[server]` fn below authenticates the
//! console session first (rules §0) and the CDR credential never reaches
//! client-visible state.
//!
//! This module owns the DIRECTORY `#[server]` fns, the shared wire types, and
//! the `directory_section` orchestrator; the view is split across
//! [`tree`] (the structured editor), [`panels`] (history / time / path /
//! delete), [`create`] (the empty-directory create flow), and the pure
//! [`edit`] helpers.
