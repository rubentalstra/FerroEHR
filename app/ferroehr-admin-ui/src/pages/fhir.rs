//! The `/fhir` screen — the CDR's FHIR connector: its mapping store, and the
//! two ways to verify a mapping without writing anything.
//!
//! Three panels over one endpoint family ([`crate::fhir`], which carries the
//! wire facts): the mapping store (list, create, edit, two-step delete), the
//! read-path viewer (what a stored mapping produces for one patient), and the
//! validate-only dry run (the verdict the ingest door would reach).
//!
//! **No console path commits a FHIR resource, and that is the design.** The
//! connector's inbound door (`POST /fhir/r4/{type}`) maps, validates and
//! commits a COMPOSITION; sending a real resource is an integration act, not an
//! operator affordance. Everything here either reads or dry-runs.
//!
//! **The mapping definition is edited as a JSON document, deliberately.** It is
//! a deep, open-ended structure — subject binding, context, per-entry paths and
//! transforms — whose shape the CDR owns; a bespoke nested form here would be a
//! second model of it, drifting the moment the connector grows a field. The
//! textarea sends the document verbatim and the CDR's own rejection comes back
//! verbatim.
//!
//! **No Effect on this screen reads a resource**: the edit form is seeded by
//! the row's own Edit click, so there is no seed to race hydration with, and
//! every mutation's answer is handled in the action's own async continuation.
