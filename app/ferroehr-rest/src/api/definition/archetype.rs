//! The ADL 1.4 / ADL 2 **archetype + artefact** wire — **our own extension**.
//!
//! No openEHR ITS-REST operation governs any route in this module. The released
//! Definition API provisions **operational templates only**: its ADL 1.4 group
//! is `/definition/template/adl1.4*`
//! (`specifications/operations/definition_template_adl1.4_{list,upload,get,example_get}.yaml`)
//! and its ADL 2 group `/definition/template/adl2*` — neither declares an
//! archetype resource, a generic artefact resource, a count, or a DELETE. The
//! SM nevertheless declares those operations
//! (`docs/specs/openehr/SM/docs/UML/classes/i_definition_adl14.adoc`:
//! `upload_archetype` / `get_archetype` / `list_archetypes` /
//! `delete_archetype`;
//! `docs/specs/openehr/SM/docs/UML/classes/i_definition_adl2.adoc`:
//! `list_archetypes` / `archetypes_count` / `list_artefacts` /
//! `artefacts_count` / `delete_artefact`), so these routes are the honest
//! realization of a *service* basis with no *wire* basis, for ADL 1.4 and
//! ADL 2 alike.
//!
//! Every route here is therefore **excluded from ITS-REST wire conformance**:
//! it gates the `Adl14ArchetypeProvisioning` / `Adl2ArchetypeProvisioning`
//! CAPABILITY verdicts only. The envelope deliberately mirrors the released
//! template surface (same base segment layout, same status vocabulary) so
//! clients see one consistent Definition API, but every branch is ours — the
//! overview conventions the routes follow are a convention they chose, never an
//! obligation they inherit.
//!
//! Mount: inside the ITS-REST API router, so the full paths are
//! `{base_path}/definition/archetype/adl1.4…`,
//! `{base_path}/definition/archetype/adl2…` and
//! `{base_path}/definition/artefact/adl2…`. Nesting keeps the auth /
//! ATNA-audit / ABAC middleware stack uniform across the whole HTTP surface.
//! There is no separate config gate: the archetype surface lives and dies with
//! the DEFINITION group, exactly like the released template routes.
//!
//! ## The refusal classes every route here carries
//!
//! NOTE (no openEHR spec governs role semantics on an unspecified route — our
//! own design/extension): these routes sit inside the API subtree, so the
//! shared authentication + RBAC layer answers before any handler runs. A
//! request carrying no valid principal is `401`; an authenticated principal
//! carrying the configured read-only role is `403` on the WRITE routes (the
//! upload and the deletes) and unaffected on the reads. Both branches are
//! declared per operation below so the served `OpenAPI` names every refusal a
//! client can meet — the coarse operation class is `Clinical` (the routes are
//! not under `/admin/`, so no ADMIN role is required).
