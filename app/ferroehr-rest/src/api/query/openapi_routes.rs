//! Native `utoipa-axum` routing for the Query API group (ad-hoc + stored AQL).
//!
//! Operation semantics are the ITS-REST Query API (`docs/specs/openehr/ITS-REST`;
//! AQL 1.1); no openEHR spec governs the OAS layout. Each handler forwards to the
//! group dispatcher through [`guarded_dispatch`].
//!
//! The Query API is one of the few groups with dedicated released prose
//! (`docs/query/Request.md`, `Response.md`, `Query_types.md`,
//! `Qualified_query_name.md`, all STABLE in Release 1.1.0), so the declarations
//! below follow that text wherever it conflicts with the released OAS, which
//! grounds only what the docs text leaves silent.
//!
//! ## Prose-vs-OAS reconciliations (documented real wire)
//!
//! - **`ehr_id` scope** (`docs/query/Request.md` §About the `ehr_id`
//!   parameter): every operation — `GET` and `POST` alike — accepts the EHR
//!   scope as the `ehr_id` query parameter OR the `openehr-ehr-id` request
//!   header. Supplying both is only accepted when they name the same EHR; a
//!   conflict is a `400` (the released text is silent on precedence, so that
//!   is our own handling). A well-formed-but-absent `ehr_id` is a `404`, a malformed UUID
//!   a `400`.
//! - **URL parameters on the `POST`s**: `Request.md`'s SHOULD-list is headed
//!   "All query execution requests" and draws no `GET`/`POST` distinction, so
//!   the three `POST`s accept `offset`/`fetch`/named `$parameter` binds from the
//!   query string as well as from the body. Precedence between the two carriers
//!   is unassigned, so the same rule applies: equal values are accepted,
//!   conflicting values are a `400`.
//! - **JSON-only response** (`200_Query.yaml` declares `application/json`; the
//!   `RESULT_SET` has no canonical-XML shape): an exclusively-XML `Accept`
//!   negotiates to `406` on every operation — documented below as our real wire
//!   though the OAS does not enumerate `406`. The `POST`s answer a non-JSON
//!   request `Content-Type` with `415`, likewise OAS-undeclared and likewise a
//!   cross-cutting MUST (`Resources.md` §"JSON Format").
//! - **`ETag`** (`200_Query.yaml` + `headers/ETag_RESULT_SET.yaml`): the `200`
//!   carries a weak `W/"…"` `ETag` — a deterministic content digest of the
//!   assembled `RESULT_SET` (the schema carries no `id`), set only on success.
//! - **`408`** (`408_Query.yaml`): a query that overruns the configured
//!   execution budget (`FERROEHR__QUERY__TIMEOUT_MS`) is a `408 Request Timeout`.
//! - **POST body** (`AdhocQueryExecute` / `Query` schemas): the POST forms carry
//!   `offset`/`fetch`/`query_parameters` (and `q` for ad-hoc) in the JSON body;
//!   the `ehr_id` scope still comes from the query string or header. Every
//!   `Query` member is OPTIONAL on the wire — the released schema's
//!   `required: [offset, fetch, query_parameters]` cannot stand against the
//!   docs text that gives `offset` a default of `0` and leaves `fetch`
//!   implementation-defined (a required member cannot default), so `{}`
//!   executes a parameterless stored query.
