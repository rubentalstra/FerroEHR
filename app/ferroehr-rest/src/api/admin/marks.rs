//! The ADMIN **legal marks** wire — **our own extension**.
//!
//! No openEHR ITS-REST operation and no SM interface governs any route here.
//! The released Admin API is two EHR deletes
//! (`docs/specs/openehr/ITS-REST/specifications/admin.openapi.yaml`), and the
//! SM's admin interfaces are the statistics, archive and dump/load calls; none
//! of them mentions restriction of processing, an objection to research, or a
//! retention period. The RM is equally silent, and deliberately so: the one
//! flag that looks like a fit, `EHR_STATUS.is_queryable`, limits population
//! queries and nothing else (RM ehr `master04-ehr_package.adoc` §EHR Status),
//! while access decisions run through `EHR_ACCESS` (§EHR Access) and content is
//! indelible (RM common `master06-change_control_package.adoc` §Logical
//! Deletion).
//!
//! What the routes serve is the law: GDPR Art. 18 (restriction), Art. 21(6)
//! (the research objection), Art. 5(1)(e) and Art. 30(1)(f) (retention), with
//! DSG Art. 25 Abs. 2 lit. d and EPDV Art. 10 beside them
//! (`docs/law/eu/gdpr/text.html`, `docs/law/ch/fadp/text-de.html`,
//! `docs/law/ch/epdv/text-de.html`). Setting a mark is the controller's act,
//! never the server's, and none of it deletes anything: the retention routes
//! answer what has fallen due and leave the decision where it belongs.
//!
//! Gating: mounted under `/admin/`, so every route inherits the group's RBAC
//! Admin class (`401`/`403`) and the `AppConfig::admin.enabled` config gate
//! (`405` with an empty `Allow` when off) unchanged.
