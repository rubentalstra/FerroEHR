//! The ADMIN **archive** wire — **our own extension**.
//!
//! No openEHR ITS-REST operation governs any route here. The released Admin
//! API is exactly two EHR deletes (`specifications/admin.openapi.yaml`), while
//! the SM declares an archive interface the release never surfaced —
//! `docs/specs/openehr/SM/docs/UML/classes/i_admin_archive.adoc`:
//! `archive_ehrs` ("Move selected EHRs to archival storage") and
//! `archive_parties` ("Move selected Parties and relationships to archival
//! storage"), with `ehr_id_does_not_exist` / `party_id_does_not_exist` as their
//! declared errors. No released ITS-REST operation covers either call.
//!
//! These routes are the honest realization of that service basis, and are
//! **excluded from ITS-REST wire conformance**: they gate the `EhrArchive` /
//! `DemographicArchive` CAPABILITY verdicts only.
//!
//! Every route is all-or-nothing: each id in the list is existence-checked
//! before anything is written, so an unknown id leaves the repository untouched
//! (the SM declares the not-found error on the operation, not per element).
//! Archiving marks the objects archived AND physically moves their rows to the
//! server's cold storage tier; archival stays read-neutral — the archived
//! objects remain retrievable, served from that tier — so no resource
//! representation changes and the success is a bodyless `204`.
//!
//! The two `…/restore` routes are the reverse movement, and they realize NO SM
//! operation: `i_admin_archive.adoc` declares the two archive calls and no
//! un-archive counterpart, so naming one would be a false claim. They are our
//! own design end to end — an archival tier is only trustworthy if the move it
//! performs can be undone deliberately rather than only as the side effect of a
//! write (which thaws the object it touches). Restoring is idempotent in the
//! same way archiving is: an object with nothing archived restores nothing and
//! succeeds.
//!
//! Gating: mounted under `/admin/`, so every route inherits the group's RBAC
//! Admin class (`401`/`403`, our own authorization design) and the
//! `AppConfig::admin.enabled` config gate (`405` with an empty `Allow` when
//! off) unchanged.
