//! The ADMIN **storage-integrity** wire — **our own extension**.
//!
//! No openEHR ITS-REST operation governs this route, and no SM interface
//! declares it either. The released Admin API is exactly two EHR deletes
//! (`specifications/admin.openapi.yaml`), and
//! `docs/specs/openehr/SM/docs/UML/classes/i_admin_service.adoc` declares
//! deletes, archival and reporting — nothing that inspects stored data for
//! damage. No openEHR spec governs storage mechanics at all, so both the
//! two-copy storage design and this route over it are ours.
//!
//! What it exposes: the storage keeps every version's content twice — the
//! materialized `vo_version.body` a point read serves, and the decomposed
//! `node` rows the AQL engine queries. Read-time signature verification (RM
//! common `master06-change_control_package.adoc` §Digital Signature) covers
//! the first copy. This route re-derives the second one and compares, so
//! tampering or corruption of either becomes visible.
//!
//! It is a `POST` because it is an action, not a resource: RFC 9110 §9.3.3
//! defines `POST` as "providing a block of data … to a data-handling process",
//! while a `GET` would present an expensive whole-repository scan as a
//! cacheable representation.
//!
//! Gating: mounted under `/admin/`, so it inherits the group's two gates
//! unchanged — the coarse RBAC `OperationClass::Admin` classifier (`401`
//! unauthenticated / `403` non-admin, our own authorization design; the
//! released admin operations carry `security: []`) and the
//! `AppConfig::admin.enabled` config gate, which answers `405` with an empty
//! `Allow` while the group is off (`crate::api::admin::dispatch`, whose ground
//! is the overview rule "If a method is recognized but not allowed for the
//! target resource, the response SHOULD be `405 Method Not Allowed` status
//! code" — `docs/overview/Requests_and_responses.md` §"HTTP Methods").
