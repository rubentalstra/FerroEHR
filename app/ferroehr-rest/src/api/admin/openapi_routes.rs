//! Native `utoipa-axum` routing for the **Admin API group** — the two released
//! ITS-REST admin operations plus three of our own extension routes.
//!
//! Each `#[utoipa::path]` handler single-sources its route and its `OpenAPI`
//! path, then forwards to the group dispatcher ([`super::dispatch::dispatch`])
//! through [`guarded_dispatch`], so the wire behaviour is identical to the
//! former table-driven `mount` adapter.
//!
//! ## Release state
//!
//! The Admin API is `DEVELOPMENT`-state within ITS-REST Release-1.1.0 — "This
//! specification is in the `DEVELOPMENT` state"
//! (`docs/specs/openehr/ITS-REST/specifications/docs/admin/Description.md`
//! §Status). That is a **reporting qualifier only**: the BCP-14 requirement
//! force of the released text is not state-qualified, so every MUST/SHOULD
//! below binds exactly as it does on a STABLE group, and nothing here is marked
//! `deprecated` except where the released docs text itself deprecates it. The
//! declarations are pinned to that release, not to the upstream development
//! branch.
//!
//! ## The released surface is two operations
//!
//! `specifications/admin.openapi.yaml` mounts exactly `DELETE
//! /admin/ehr/{ehr_id}` (`operations/admin_ehr_delete.yaml`) and `DELETE
//! /admin/ehr/all{?ehr_id*}` (`operations/admin_ehr_delete_all.yaml`), both
//! tagged `EHR`. The other three routes below (`/admin/template/{template_id}`,
//! `/admin/query/{qualified_query_name}/{version}`, `/admin/config`) are **OUR
//! OWN EXTENSION** — no ITS-REST operation governs them — and are excluded from
//! any conformance-profile claim.
//!
//! ## What the released responses do (and do not) declare
//!
//! - **No response header exists on any released admin response.** Every
//!   response file the two operations `$ref` —
//!   `responses/202.yaml`, `responses/204_deleted_hard.yaml`,
//!   `responses/404.yaml`, `responses/404_unknown_ehr_id.yaml`,
//!   `responses/405.yaml` — carries a `description:` and nothing else: no
//!   `headers:` block anywhere. There is therefore no released response header
//!   to declare on either operation, and none is declared. The ONE response
//!   header this group emits at all is the `Allow` on the config-gate `405`
//!   (below), which comes from RFC 9110, not from the openEHR text.
//! - **`Location` is never declared, on any route of the group.**
//!   `docs/overview/Requests_and_responses.md` §"Deprecated headers": the
//!   `Location` response header on `GET` "was an incorrect use of the header,
//!   and it is now deprecated", and "Similarly, the `Location` response header
//!   was deprecated from responses of `DELETE` methods." Four routes here are
//!   `DELETE` and the fifth is a `GET`, so no response of this group slots it.
//! - **Success is always `204`, never `202`.** Both released operations say:
//!   "The server may execute this operation asynchronously (e.g. in batches),
//!   in which case returns status `202 Accepted`. If the deletion is processed
//!   synchronously and completes successfully, the server returns status `204
//!   No Content`." Every delete here is synchronous, so `204` is the only
//!   success and the `202` branch (`responses/202.yaml`: "`202 Accepted` is
//!   returned when the requested operation has been accepted for processing,
//!   but processing has not been completed or may not have started (i.e. when
//!   requests are processed asynchronously).") is NEVER produced. It is
//!   documented in prose on both operations and deliberately NOT declared as a
//!   served response — the served document describes only what this server
//!   emits.
//!
//! ## `405` when the group is disabled — two different grounds
//!
//! The group is config-gated (`AppConfig::admin.enabled`, default false); when
//! off EVERY route here answers `405 Method Not Allowed` with the openEHR error
//! body, uniformly, before the backend is touched (`admin/dispatch.rs`). The
//! spec ground for that status differs per route and each declaration cites its
//! own:
//!
//! - `admin_ehr_delete_all` has its OWN released provenance — the NOTE in
//!   `operations/admin_ehr_delete_all.yaml`: "This functionality is intended
//!   primarily for **development** or **testing** purposes and may be disabled
//!   in **production** environments, in which case server may respond with `405
//!   Method Not Allowed`." — with `responses/405.yaml` enumerated ("`405 Method
//!   Not Allowed` is returned when the service knows the request method, but
//!   the target resource doesn't support this method (e.g. due to security
//!   concerns).").
//! - `admin_ehr_delete` does NOT enumerate `405`, and the three extension
//!   routes have no released file at all, so the bulk route's NOTE is not their
//!   ground. Theirs is the cross-cutting overview rule: "If a method is
//!   recognized but not allowed for the target resource, the response SHOULD be
//!   `405 Method Not Allowed` status code"
//!   (`docs/overview/Requests_and_responses.md` §"HTTP Methods").
//!
//! Because that `405` comes from a MATCHED handler, axum's allow-header
//! machinery (which only decorates a *method fallback*) never runs, so the
//! `Allow` RFC 9110 §15.5.6 makes mandatory on every `405` is set explicitly —
//! with the EMPTY field value RFC 9110 §10.2.1 defines for a resource
//! "temporarily disabled by configuration".
//!
//! ## Authorization is our own design
//!
//! Every released admin operation carries `security: []`
//! (`specifications/admin.openapi.yaml`) and declares no `401`/`403`, and the
//! overview only says services "SHOULD implement and support an HTTP
//! Authentication and Authorization framework, though this specification does
//! not mandate a specific authentication scheme"
//! (`docs/overview/Requests_and_responses.md` §"Authentication and
//! authorization"). The `401`/`403` branches declared on all five routes are
//! therefore OUR OWN design — no openEHR spec governs them: everything under
//! `/admin/` is classified `OperationClass::Admin` by the RBAC gate
//! ([`crate::extensions::access::authz`]), which runs before the config gate,
//! so an unauthenticated caller sees `401` and a non-admin principal `403`
//! whether or not the group is enabled.
//!
//! ## The `ehr_id` query form
//!
//! `parameters/query/ehr_id_Admin.yaml` is `in: query`, `style: form`,
//! `explode: true`, and "An optional parameter to perform the operation on a
//! subset of EHRs" — so an ABSENT or empty list means "delete ALL EHRs"
//! (`admin_ehr_delete_all.yaml`: "Deletes all or multiple EHRs, or a specified
//! subset of EHRs identified using the `ehr_id` query parameter."). Both the
//! exploded/repeated form (`?ehr_id=a&ehr_id=b`, which is what `explode: true`
//! means) and a comma-separated single value (`?ehr_id=a,b`) are accepted.
//! Reading the list straight from the RAW query string is deliberate, not an
//! oversight: the generated `AdminEhrDeleteAllParams.ehr_id` is an
//! `Option<String>` that the type-directed params deserializer collapses a
//! repeated parameter into — the reasoning is spelled out at the
//! `admin_ehr_delete_all` arm of `admin/dispatch.rs`.
//!
//! NOTE (path): the generated `admin_ehr_delete_all` route carries an RFC 6570
//! query-expansion suffix (`/admin/ehr/all{?ehr_id*}`) that is not part of the
//! resource path; the mounted and documented path is the plain
//! `/admin/ehr/all` (the `ehr_id` list is read from the query string), which is
//! the normalization [`crate::api::normalize_path`] applies to every generated
//! template.
