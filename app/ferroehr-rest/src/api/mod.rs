//! The ITS-REST **API hub** — the assembly over the generated `ROUTES` tables.
//!
//! The crate is laid out per ITS-REST specification: one module per API group under
//! `api/`, each split along the spec's own resource boundaries and citing its
//! governing section. This hub is the wiring layer that turns the generated
//! contract into one axum router.
//!
//! ## The generated contract
//!
//! `emit-rest` produces, per API group, a `ROUTES` table of
//! `(method, path, operation_id)` and one `*Params` struct per operation
//! (`openehr_its::rest::generated::{ehr,query,definition,admin,demographic}`).
//! The System API is not part of that contract (no `system` group is emitted),
//! so its single `OPTIONS /` operation is hand-written in [`system`] and mounted
//! by [`crate::router::router`], not here.
//!
//! ## The per-group modules
//!
//! Each group owns a dispatcher — an operation-id `match` that rebuilds the
//! exact `*Params` from the raw request parts, calls the SM native-API method on
//! [`AppState`], and renders a negotiated response:
//!
//! - [`ehr`] — the EHR API (EHR, `EHR_STATUS`, `VERSIONED_EHR_STATUS`, COMPOSITION,
//!   `VERSIONED_COMPOSITION`, DIRECTORY, CONTRIBUTION), re-exporting
//!   `ehr::dispatch::dispatch`.
//! - [`query`] — the Query API (adhoc + stored), re-exporting `query::dispatch`.
//! - [`definition`] — the Definition API (ADL 1.4 / ADL 2 templates + stored
//!   queries), re-exporting `definition::dispatch`.
//! - [`demographic`] — the Demographic API (spec-governed, DEVELOPMENT) plus the
//!   own-design `PARTY_RELATIONSHIP` extension routes, re-exporting
//!   `demographic::dispatch` + `demographic::relationship_routes` (the native
//!   `utoipa-axum` router for the extension).
//! - [`admin`] — the Admin API (physical EHR delete), whose dispatcher is reached
//!   as `admin::dispatch::dispatch` (the group publishes no re-export), plus the
//!   own-design `archive` + activity-`report` + `dump_load` extension routes
//!   under the same `/admin/` gates.
//! - [`message`] — the own-design MESSAGE group (`I_EHR_EXTRACT_SERVICE` +
//!   `I_TDD_SERVICE`); the release publishes no message API at all, so the whole
//!   group is an extension under its own `/message/` resource root.
//! - [`system`] — the System API manifest ([`system::options::SystemManifest`],
//!   `ferroehr::config::server::SystemOptionsConfig`), assembled and mounted by [`crate::router::router`].
//!
//! `item_tags` is not a group: it is the one `ITEM_TAG` write-wrapper
//! implementation (`item_tags::pending` / `item_tags::persist` /
//! `item_tags::echo` / `item_tags::write_body`) the EHR and demographic
//! dispatchers share, so the two cannot drift.
//!
//! Every group — the standardised ITS-REST groups above and the own-design
//! extension surfaces ([`crate::extensions`]: terminology, event subscription,
//! multi-tenancy admin, FHIR connector) — is built as a native `utoipa-axum`
//! router ([`OpenApiRouter`] + `routes!`), so each operation's route and its
//! `OpenAPI` path metadata come from ONE `#[utoipa::path]` handler. They are
//! composed by `api_openapi_router`; the extension groups are config-gated
//! inside each handler (a disabled group answers `404`), so a stock server
//! exposes only the standardised ITS-REST surface.
