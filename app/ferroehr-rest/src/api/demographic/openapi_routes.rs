//! Native `utoipa-axum` routing for the **standard Demographic API group**:
//! the party CRUD (`agent`/`group`/`organisation`/`person`/`role`), the
//! `versioned_party` reads, `contribution` create/get, and the `ITEM_TAG`
//! sub-resources (`demographic_tags_get` + the per-party `*_tags_*`).
//!
//! Each `#[utoipa::path]` handler single-sources its route and its `OpenAPI`
//! path, then forwards to the demographic group dispatcher
//! ([`super::dispatch::dispatch`]) through [`guarded_dispatch`], so the
//! `EHR_ACCESS` gate, the ABAC PEP and the ATNA audit tagging apply uniformly.
//!
//! The Demographic API is `DEVELOPMENT`-state within ITS-REST Release-1.1.0
//! (`docs/demographic/Description.md` §Status). That is a reporting qualifier
//! only: the BCP-14 requirement force of the released text is not
//! state-qualified, so every MUST and SHOULD below binds as it would on a STABLE
//! group, and the declarations are pinned to that release rather than to the
//! upstream development branch.
//!
//! The five party CRUD quintets are byte-identical across the kinds on the
//! released wire, so each kind mirrors the same
//! `operations/person_{create,get,update,delete}.yaml` and its `$ref`d
//! components, differing only in the RM type and its own `Location_*` header.
//! The `versioned_party_*`, `demographic_contribution_*` and `ITEM_TAG`
//! families are declared from their own operation files. Everything those files
//! leave open is filled from the released overview chapters, the docs text
//! winning every conflict: `Requests_and_responses.md` (the weak `W/` `ETag`
//! MUST, the `Prefer` triad, the committal-header MUST-accept rule, the
//! `If-Match` `400`/`412` rules, §Location's MUST-NOT on `GET`) and
//! `Resources.md` (the `415`/`406` format MUSTs). Two consequences show up on
//! every declaration:
//!
//! - `Location` is never declared on a read or a delete. The released responses
//!   slot `headers/Location_deprecated.yaml`, and §Location confines the header
//!   to "resource creation (e.g., `201 Created`) or redirect responses", so
//!   those slots are left undeclared rather than declared-as-deprecated.
//! - Party resources are canonical-only. The released operations reference
//!   `Accept_LOCATABLE.yaml`, whose enum admits the Simplified MIME types, but a
//!   PARTY is not templated and §openehr-template-id scopes the only
//!   template-naming header to "committing COMPOSITION", so a Simplified party
//!   payload cannot name the template it would be expanded against. Our handling
//!   of that gap, which the released text does not fix: a Simplified
//!   `Content-Type` is `415` and a Simplified-only `Accept` is `406`, the two
//!   MUSTs `Resources.md` §"Simplified Formats" states.
//!
//! The own-design `PARTY_RELATIONSHIP` extension lives in
//! [`super::relationship`]; no ITS-REST operation governs it.

                        taken from VERSION.uid.value (i.e. a `version_uid`), \

                        `versioned_object_uid`). The former is used to update \
                        the tags of a particular GROUP version (e.g. one \

                        whereas the latter (e.g. an identifier like \
                        `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515`) is be used to \

                        family source it from VERSIONED_PARTY, and all three \

                        editorial split inside one operation family, \
                        adjudicated; both \
                        name the same container. The two forms address \
                        DISJOINT collections: an ITEM_TAG carries exactly one \

                        \"which may be a `VERSIONED_OBJECT<T>` or a \
                        `VERSION<T>`\"), so a tag written against the \
                        container is invisible to the version form and a tag \
                        written against \
                        `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::openEHRSys.example.com::1` \
                        is invisible both to the container form and to every \
                        other version. The container form names the \

                        version's — there is no implicit-latest reading here. \
                        So replacing the container's list never touches any \
                        version's list, and replacing one version's list never \

                                         as stated here. Items are typed \
                                         `schemas/demographic/ItemTagOfOrganisation.yaml`.) \
                                         Every row carries the SERVER-ASSIGNED \
                                         `target` and `owner_id`; neither is \
                                         client input. `target` names the \
                                         ADDRESSED collection — `{namespace: \
                                         \"demographic\", type: <PARTY kind>, \
                                         id: <the addressed uid>}`, whose `id` \
                                         is a `HIER_OBJECT_ID` for the \
                                         container form and an \
                                         `OBJECT_VERSION_ID` for the version \
                                         form — and `owner_id` names the \
                                         owning VERSIONED_PARTY. That \
                                         `owner_id` is OUR OWN DESIGN: RM \
                                         `item_tag.adoc` says only \
                                         \"Identifier of owner object, such as \
                                         EHR\" and a demographic party has no \
                                         EHR, so no released sentence fixes \
                                         it; the released `ItemTagOf*` \
                                         examples show `{namespace: local, \
                                         type: SYSTEM}` instead, which nothing \
                                         requires. The position is \
                                         adjudicated. `target_path` \
                                         is present only on tags that carry \
                                         one — it is 0..1 in the RM — and the \
                                         empty string normalizes to ABSENT, so \
                                         a stored tag never echoes the \
                                         `target_path: \"\"` the released \
                                         `ItemTagOf*` examples all show; that \

                        The two forms address DISJOINT collections: an \

                        version form and a tag written against \

                        version's — there is no implicit-latest reading here. \
                        So deleting a key from the container leaves the same \
