//! `I_TDD_SERVICE` over the MESSAGE extension wire — **our own extension**
//! (see [`super`] for the whole group's spec-silence flag).
//!
//! `i_tdd_service.adoc` declares `import_tdd(an_ehr_id, tdd: String)`; the
//! batch form `import_tdds` carries no SM signature and is this product's
//! all-or-nothing extension of the interface (flagged in
//! `ferroehr::service::message::tdd`). The routes:
//!
//! | SM operation | route |
//! |---|---|
//! | `import_tdd(an_ehr_id, tdd)` | `POST /message/tdd/{ehr_id}` |
//! | `import_tdds(an_ehr_id, tdds)` | `POST /message/tdd/{ehr_id}/batch` |
//!
//! A TDD is an opaque `String` to the SM — concretely a template-namespaced XML
//! instance of a COMPOSITION conforming to the template-derived TDS ("a kind of
//! XSD", AM OPT2 `master02-overview.adoc` §Purpose of the OPT) — so the single
//! import takes the document as an `application/xml` body, and the batch takes
//! the SM's `List<String>` as a JSON array of such documents. Each import
//! commits through the ordinary validated COMPOSITION path, so its created
//! `OBJECT_VERSION_ID` is what the response names.
//!
//! NOTE (no openEHR spec governs role semantics on an unspecified route — our
//! own design/extension): both routes are writes behind the shared
//! authentication + RBAC layer, so both answer `401` without a valid principal
//! and `403` for a principal holding the configured read-only role, in both
//! cases before the payload is read.
//!
//! NOTE (no openEHR spec governs a batch bound — our own design/extension):
//! the batch carries NO cardinality bound of its own. The only bound is the
//! server-wide request-body limit (`ferroehr-rest::router`), which the
//! `tower-http` `RequestBodyLimitLayer` enforces as `413 Payload Too Large`
//! before routing — so an absurd batch is refused by size, never by count.
