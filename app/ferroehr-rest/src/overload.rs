//! Ingress overload protection: bounded in-flight concurrency + load shedding.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs server overload behaviour — this is our own design
//! (RFC 9110 §15.6.4 is the HTTP authority for the `503 Service Unavailable`
//! status). Under sustained offered load beyond backend (DB pool) capacity, a
//! server that accepts and queues every request unboundedly — each awaiting a
//! `sqlx` pool connection for up to the acquire timeout — grows its in-flight
//! set until the process is killed for exhausting memory. Instead the router
//! caps the number of concurrently in-flight API requests and sheds the excess
//! *immediately* with `503` + `Retry-After`, so the server degrades with clean
//! errors rather than dying.
//!
//! The mechanism is entirely stock `tower`: [`tower::limit::ConcurrencyLimit`]
//! holds a shared semaphore and only admits a request once it can acquire a
//! permit (the permit is held for the request's whole lifetime);
//! [`tower::load_shed::LoadShed`] wraps it and — because `ConcurrencyLimit`
//! reports "not ready" when no permit is free — returns an
//! [`Overloaded`] error synchronously
//! instead of waiting. [`axum::error_handling::HandleErrorLayer`] turns that
//! error back into an infallible response via [`handle_overload`]. The layer is
//! wired in [`crate::router::router`]; see that module's doc for the layer order.
