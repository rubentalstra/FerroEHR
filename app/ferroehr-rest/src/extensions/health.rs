//! The public health family at the process root: `/health`,
//! `/health/liveness`, `/health/readiness`.
//!
//! NOTE: no openEHR spec governs this — our own operational surface;
//! disposition recorded on issue #305. The vendored ITS-REST System API
//! defines exactly one operation (`OPTIONS /`, the conformance manifest,
//! `docs/specs/openehr/ITS-REST/specifications/docs/system/`) and no health
//! resource at all, so this whole family is our own extension.
//!
//! **Always mounted, never gated.** These three routes are mounted
//! unconditionally by [`crate::router::router`], outside the API subtree — so
//! outside authentication, outside the ATNA audit layer, and outside the
//! overload-shed layer. An orchestrator can therefore always probe the
//! server: no credentials, no configuration to remember, and a saturated
//! server cannot shed its own probes.
//!
//! The three contracts are deliberately different, one per client:
//!
//! | Route | Contract | Canonical client |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `GET /health` | constant `OK`, no I/O | load balancers, container `HEALTHCHECK` |
//! | `GET /health/liveness` | the same constant `OK` (path alias) | container/orchestrator liveness probe |
//! | `GET /health/readiness` | the indicator registry evaluated per call (DB ping, migrations applied, …); `200` UP/DEGRADED, `503` DOWN | orchestrator readiness probe, ops |
//!
//! This family is the ONE health surface: there is no second name for it
//! anywhere. `GET /ferroehr/rest/status` ([`crate::overview::status`]) is a
//! different contract — the product status/version document — and the
//! management surface ([`crate::extensions::management`]) carries no health
//! route at all: it is ops introspection only.
