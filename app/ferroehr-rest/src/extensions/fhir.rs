//! HTTP dispatch for the **FHIR R4 inbound connector** + mapping-store CRUD
//! over the `ferroehr::service::FhirConnectorAdapter` seam.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs this — our own enterprise feature, excluded from the
//! ITS-REST drift check. It is a persistence-boundary connector, distinct from
//! the SM Subject Proxy Service (master10): SPS reads subject variables through
//! data-binding frames, whereas this connector commits inbound FHIR resources as
//! COMPOSITIONs and serves them back.
//!
//! Three surfaces, all config-gated (`AppConfig::fhir_api_enabled`, default
//! `false`), answering `404` as an `OperationOutcome` when disabled:
//!
//! * `POST /fhir/r4/{resource_type}` — the inbound connector: the resource's
//!   mapping is resolved by type and `meta.profile`, and a COMPOSITION is built
//!   and committed through the normal validated path with `FEEDER_AUDIT`
//!   provenance. Only `STARTER_RESOURCES` is supported; anything else is a typed
//!   `501`.
//! * `GET /fhir/r4/{resource_type}?patient=…[&_count=N]` — the read façade:
//!   the enabled mappings for the type run a template-bound COMPOSITION query
//!   scoped to the patient, returning a `searchset` Bundle of reverse-mapped
//!   resources. The `patient` scope is mandatory (a missing one is a typed
//!   `400`) and an out-of-scope type is the same `501` as inbound.
//! * `/admin/fhir_mapping[/{id}]` — CRUD over the deployable mapping artefacts,
//!   mounted under `/admin/`, so the coarse RBAC gate classes it `Admin`.
//!
//! Every error on this surface is a FHIR `OperationOutcome` rather than the
//! openEHR error body: this is the FHIR boundary. Validator rejections surface
//! the openEHR validator's message verbatim in `diagnostics` — the CDR's rules
//! win, so a resource mapping to an invalid COMPOSITION is rejected `422` rather
//! than partially stored.
