//! `OpenAPI` document + Swagger UI (discoverability).
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs an OAS-serving endpoint — our own surface. The
//! Swagger UI's spec selector shows only documents this server generates itself,
//! never a vendored OAS: one filtered document per API family (`FAMILIES`, at
//! `{api-docs}/ferroehr-{family}.openapi.json`) plus the complete server surface
//! last, each derived from the single composed document built natively from
//! every `#[utoipa::path]` handler via `utoipa-axum`'s [`OpenApiRouter`]. Route
//! and `OpenAPI` path are single-sourced from one handler, so the document
//! cannot drift from the router. The vendored ITS-REST OAS bundles are codegen
//! input for the generated group contract only, and are never served.
//!
//! Authentication in the document is config-driven: the served document declares
//! exactly the one scheme in effect per [`AuthConfig`] (`openehr_auth`, bearer
//! JWT when OIDC is configured, else HTTP Basic; none when auth is disabled), so
//! the Swagger "Authorize" dialog and the per-endpoint padlocks match the running
//! server. The lock is applied to the authenticated surfaces only.
//!
//! The UI assets are served through [`utoipa_swagger_ui::serve`] rather than
//! [`utoipa_swagger_ui::SwaggerUi`]'s router, and the mount path redirects to
//! `index.html` under the mount. Both halves are load-bearing: the dist
//! `index.html` references its assets relatively, so a body served at the
//! slash-less mount path renders empty, and the trailing-slash target
//! `SwaggerUi`'s own router answers with is an infinite loop under the
//! serve-time `NormalizePathLayer`.

                       handlers: the standardised ITS-REST API groups (EHR / COMPOSITION / \
                       CONTRIBUTION / DIRECTORY / DEMOGRAPHIC / DEFINITION / QUERY / ADMIN), the \
                       own-design extensions (terminology, PARTY_RELATIONSHIP, event-subscription, \

                       (health, status, management, SMART discovery, the OpenAPI endpoints). \
                       `info.version` is this product's own SemVer; the implemented openEHR \
                       ITS-REST contract version is the document-level `x-openehr-its-rest` \
                       extension. Everything outside the standardised ITS-REST groups is OUR OWN \
                       EXTENSION — no openEHR spec governs it — and every such operation says so \
                       in its own description.\n\n\
                       **Canonical-XML lineage selection (our own extension).** openEHR publishes \
                       canonical XML in two wire lineages that differ only by the document's root \
                       namespace: `http://schemas.openehr.org/v1` (ITS-XML Release-1.0.2, the \
                       STABLE bundle) and `http://schemas.openehr.org/v2` (ITS-XML Release-2.0.0, \
                       TRIAL upstream). Every operation whose media type is `application/xml` \
                       accepts a `version` media-type parameter selecting one — \
                       `Accept: application/xml; version=1` for the response, \
                       `Content-Type: application/xml; version=1` to declare a request payload. \
                       Omitting it (or sending `version=2`) means the v2 default — the only \
                       published lineage whose schemas model the RM 1.2.0 this server serves; a \
                       non-default v1 response is labelled \
                       `Content-Type: application/xml; version=1`. No openEHR specification \
                       governs the parameter — the ITS-REST text predates the dual bundles — but \
                       its refusal branches are the released ones: an unrecognized `version` on \
                       `Accept` is `406 Not Acceptable` and on `Content-Type` is `415 Unsupported \
                       Media Type` (`Resources.md` §\"XML Format\"). Operational templates \
                       (`.../definition/template/adl1.4/...`) are always served in the v1 lineage \
