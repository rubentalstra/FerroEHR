//! Authorization for the `FerroEHR` CDR.
//!
//! Two composable layers inside the protocol adapter, authorization being an
//! adapter concern by design.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs this: the SM places authorization out of band (SM
//! `openehr_platform/master02-overview.adoc` §General Assumptions), so
//! everything here is our own enterprise design. The spec-grounded access
//! authority is the sibling `EHR_ACCESS` gate
//! ([`crate::extensions::access::ehr_access`]), which these layers compose on
//! top of:
//!
//! 1. RBAC, coarse and always on when auth is enabled: every generated ITS-REST
//!    operation is classified ([`classify`]) and gated by a role model
//!    ([`roles`]) driven by `ferroehr::config::authz::AuthzConfig`.
//! 2. ABAC, fine-grained and opt-in: a policy-decision-point seam
//!    ([`engine::PolicyEngine`]) consulted per clinical operation with resolved
//!    attributes, behind two interchangeable engines — the embedded [`cedar`]
//!    default and the [`remote::RemotePdp`].
//!
//! This module also carries the per-server authorization handle wired onto
//! [`AppState`](crate::state::AppState), which the binary builds from
//! `ferroehr::config::authz::AuthzConfig`.
//!
//! ## Module map
//! - `config` — the `ferroehr::config::authz::AuthzConfig` serde struct (the `[authz]`
//!   section of the one server config tree) + boot validation.
//! - [`roles`] — the role model, JWT-claim role extraction, and the RBAC gate
//!   decision.
//! - [`classify`] — `operation_id → OperationClass` / `ResourceKind` /
//!   `AccessMode` (total-coverage-guarded).
//! - [`request`] — the ABAC [`request::AuthzRequest`] + multi-valued fan-out.
//! - [`engine`] — the [`engine::PolicyEngine`] PDP seam + [`engine::AuthzError`].
//! - [`cedar`] — the embedded Cedar engine (schema, policy loading, reload).
//! - [`remote`] — the remote PDP client.
