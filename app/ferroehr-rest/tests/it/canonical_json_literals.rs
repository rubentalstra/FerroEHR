//! Regression gate: canonical RM shapes are BUILT from the generated
//! `openehr-*` types, never hand-written as `json!` literals.
//!
//! A `json!` literal carrying a `"_type"` key is, by definition, a hand-rolled
//! canonical openEHR fragment — the scanner mechanics live in
//! [`testkit::json_literals`] (shared by every crate's gate); this file owns
//! ONLY this crate's adjudications. To add a site, classify it and put it in
//! [`ALLOWLIST`] with a one-line reason — every entry must name why that
//! file's literals are NOT a synthesized canonical shape. A stale entry
//! (allowlisted file with no remaining literals) fails too, so the list
//! cannot rot (issue #1686).

/// Files whose `_type`-carrying `json!` literals are classified as something
/// other than a synthesized canonical shape, each with the reason.
