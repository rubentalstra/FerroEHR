//! The two-DSN posture: the server assembled on one login role per
//! pseudonymisation domain, serving both domains and reaching neither across.
//!
//! Every other suite here runs the schema separation through ONE credential —
//! `FerroEhrService::new` derives the demographic pool from the clinical pool's
//! own connect options and swaps only the `search_path`. That proves the
//! routing, and nothing about the posture the book recommends and the chart
//! configures: `[db] demographic_url` pointing at a role that is a member of
//! `ferroehr_demographic` while `[db] url` authenticates as `ferroehr_ehr`.
//!
//! So these tests take the path the binary takes — two [`DbConfig`] DSNs,
//! [`ferroehr::db::connect`] and [`ferroehr::db::connect_demographic`], the two
//! pools handed to the service — and then assert three things: both domains
//! serve through the assembled router, each of the server's OWN pools is
//! refused the other domain's relations for want of privilege, and a
//! single-DSN deployment still serves both domains, so the split stays a
//! choice rather than a requirement.
//!
//! NOTE: no openEHR spec governs database roles or the pseudonymisation
//! boundary — our own design/extension (GDPR Art. 4(5) and Art. 32(1)(a); the
//! migrations carry the derivation).
