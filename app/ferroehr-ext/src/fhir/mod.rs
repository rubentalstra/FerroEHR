//! The FHIR integration core: the mapping model and FLAT builder, the outbound
//! reverse-map, the feeder-audit probe, the ATNA `AuditEvent` renderer, and the
//! terminology-response decoder.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs FHIR resource representation — our own
//! design/extension. This module owns only the pure conversion logic and the
//! typed `fhir-model` resource surface, which no other crate names; the
//! service and REST glue lives in the platform crate behind its `fhir` feature.
//!
//! The connector speaks FHIR R4, the release its wire advertises (`/fhir/r4`).
//! Every resource it builds and every data type they carry is outside R4B's
//! changed set, so the documents are equally valid under either release:
//! "implementers that do not use the specific portions where changes have been
//! made can continue to use either R4 or R4B without any functional difference"
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/r4b-explanation.html>). [`mapping`] and
//! [`reverse`] fix no resource at all — the resource type is mapping data.
//! [`terminology`] stays R4B by its own design, decoding responses from external
//! servers whose release is the remote's property.
