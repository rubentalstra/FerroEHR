//! The one integration-test binary of `ferroehr-ext`: one module per
//! feature-gated integration, each compiled only under its feature, so
//! `--all-features` runs everything and a slim build compiles nothing here.
//!
//! These are behaviour tests over the crate's public seams — the typed
//! terminology decoders, the `EventPublisher` contract, the multimedia engine
//! over a real (in-memory) object store. The broker-backed and wiremock-backed
//! journeys stay in `app/ferroehr/tests/it`, where the platform wires the
//! integrations in; nothing here repeats them.
