//! The URL-driven tab strip's one pill link.
//!
//! A detail screen's tabs are `?tab=` links, not client state, so a tab is
//! shareable and refresh-safe and the strip works before the WASM bundle loads
//! — the router intercepts the anchors once it does. Each screen still spells
//! its own strip, because the tabs it offers and the route they hang off are
//! its own; what is shared is one tab's look and its selected/idle split.
