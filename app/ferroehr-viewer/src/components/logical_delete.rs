//! The **logical delete** affordance a versioned object's detail screen carries
//! above its tabs.
//!
//! openEHR's delete is logical: it commits a `523|deleted|` version, so the
//! object stops resolving as current while every earlier version stays readable
//! by its own uid (RM common master06 §Logical Deletion). Every screen that
//! offers it does the same four things — a danger button, the shared
//! confirmation modal, both outcome toasts, and a return to the listing the
//! object came from — so they are spelled once here. The caller owns the
//! `Action` (each family deletes through its own server function) and the
//! consequence copy naming its object.
