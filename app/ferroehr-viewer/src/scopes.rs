//! The scope previewer's presentation model: one pure function from a SMART
//! scope string to the grant the console renders for it.
//!
//! **The parse is never ours.** It is `openehr_its::rest::smart_scopes` — the
//! ONE SMART on openEHR grammar
//! (`docs/specs/openehr/ITS-REST/docs/smart_app_launch/master08-scopes.adoc`
//! §Resource Scopes, plus the master07/master09 launch contexts), the same code
//! the CDR's scope gate enforces with, so what this drawer explains and what the
//! CDR permits cannot drift. This module only turns a parsed scope into labels,
//! chips and copy — and, for a string the grammar REJECTED, the diagnosis that
//! says which part of the form is wrong instead of dropping it silently.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of the input string (no clock, no request,
//! no I/O), which is what makes the previewer hydration-safe by construction and
//! lets it run in the browser rather than round-tripping the BFF for a parse.
//!
//! **Capability is not authorization.** A scope NARROWS what a token may ask
//! for; it grants nothing by itself. master08 §Scopes: the Platform validates
//! requested scopes "against the _Application_ registration metadata, applicable
//! access control policies, the authenticated user's permissions" — so the CDR
//! remains the enforcer and a previewed grant is an upper bound, never a promise.
