//! `PARTY_RELATIONSHIP` — the relationship index, the relationship detail, and
//! the party detail's Relationships tab.
//!
//! NOTE: the released Demographic API defines no `party_relationship` path at
//! all — these routes are the CDR's own extension realizing SM
//! `I_PARTY_RELATIONSHIP` (`docs/specs/openehr/SM/docs/UML/classes/i_party_relationship.adoc`).
//!
//! A relationship therefore exists in the CDR in TWO shapes, and the viewer
//! shows both because the spec models both:
//!
//! - **Inline, on its source party.** `PARTY.relationships` is
//!   "Relationships in which this Party takes part as source", with the
//!   invariant `Relationships_validity` requiring every entry's `source` to be
//!   that party
//!   (`docs/specs/openehr/RM/docs/UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.demographic.party.adoc`).
//!   That list is part of the party document, so the Relationships tab reads it
//!   from the party itself.
//! - **As its own versioned object**, addressed by
//!   `/demographic/party_relationship/{uid_based_id}` — the SM's shape, which
//!   the extension routes serve with the same CRUD + versioned-read envelope as
//!   a party.
//!
//! The two are not synchronized by the CDR, and neither is a view of the other.
//! One consequence is visible on every screen here: **the TARGET side of a
//! relationship is not enumerable.** `PARTY.reverse_relationships` —
//! "References to relationships in which this Party takes part as target" — is
//! a derived `0..1` function in the RM, and the CDR leaves it unpopulated, so
//! no request answers "which relationships point AT this party". A party's tab
//! says so rather than implying the list it shows is complete; the relationship
//! detail links BOTH endpoints, which is the reachable direction.
