//! The demographic `ITEM_TAG` surface: the space-wide tag index the browser
//! screen lists, and the per-party tag editor on the party detail's Tags tab.
//!
//! Both are released operations. The index is
//! `GET /demographic/tags`, whose list "can be filtered by the given one or
//! more `tag_key`, `tag_value`, `tag_target_path` query parameters" and where
//! "in case no such parameter is provided then all `ITEM_TAG` resources will be
//! retrieved" (`operations/demographic_tags_get.yaml`). The editor is the
//! per-kind trio `{kind}_tags_get` / `{kind}_tags_update` /
//! `{kind}_tags_delete` (`operations/person_tags_*.yaml`).
//!
//! The row type, the wire codec, the merge and the editor panel are the shared
//! kit ([`crate::components::item_tags`]), which carries the tag model's own
//! rules — whole-collection replace, `(key, target_path)` identity, no
//! conditional header — so this module is only the demographic ROUTES.
//!
//! The addressed collection here is the version CONTAINER's: the released
//! operation makes the container and a single VERSION two DISJOINT collections
//! of the same object (`operations/person_tags_get.yaml`), and a container tag
//! survives the party's next version, which is what an operator marking a party
//! means.
