//! The CDR **Admin API** surface the viewer consumes.
//!
//! The availability probe every admin affordance is gated on, plus the three
//! destructive operations (template delete, stored-query delete, physical EHR
//! delete).
//!
//! The CDR's admin group is **off by default**, and while it is disabled every
//! admin route answers `405 Method Not Allowed` with an empty `Allow` (the
//! route exists but supports no method — ITS-REST overview
//! `Requests_and_responses.md` §HTTP Methods: "If a method is recognized but not
//! allowed for the target resource, the response SHOULD be 405 Method Not
//! Allowed"). The viewer therefore discovers the group before offering any of
//! it, and renders no destructive affordance at all when it is not mounted.
//!
//! NOTE: admin availability is discovered via the System API conformance
//! manifest (`OPTIONS {base_path}` → `endpoints[]`,
//! `docs/specs/openehr/ITS-REST/specifications/system.openapi.yaml`) — the
//! spec's own capability-discovery operation, so the viewer never pokes a
//! destructive group to learn whether it exists.
//!
//! **Capability is not authorization.** The manifest says the admin group is
//! MOUNTED; whether THIS session may use it is answered per request by the CDR's
//! RBAC (`401`/`403`), and a refusal on click surfaces through
//! [`delete_failure_copy`].
//!
//! NOTE: no openEHR spec governs the viewer, and none governs the template or
//! stored-query deletes it drives either — our own design. The EHR delete is the
//! spec-grounded one: SM `I_ADMIN_SERVICE.physical_ehr_delete`
//! (`docs/specs/openehr/SM/docs/UML/classes/i_admin_service.adoc`
//! §`physical_ehr_delete`), whose `ehr_id_does_not_exist` error is the `404`.
//!
//! Every `#[server]` fn guards with
//! [`require_session`](crate::session::require_session) first (a server fn is
//! a public HTTP endpoint) and keeps the CDR credential server-side.
