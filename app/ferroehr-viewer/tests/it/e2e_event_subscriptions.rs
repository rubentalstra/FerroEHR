//! End-to-end journeys over the viewer's **event subscriptions**
//! (`/subscriptions`): the CRUD round trip, and the CDR's duplicate-name
//! refusal surfacing verbatim beside the failure toast.
//!
//! The screen is probe-gated on the CDR serving its event-subscription admin
//! API, which the composed E2E stack enables (`docker/viewer/e2e-env.yml`
//! sets `FERROEHR__EVENTS__ADMIN_API`); a stack without it hides the nav entry
//! entirely, and these journeys say so in their failure message rather than
//! passing vacuously. The hidden-when-absent half is unit-tested in
//! `ferroehr_viewer::subscriptions` against a probe that found no surface —
//! the same split as the admin-group, management and tenancy journeys.
//!
//! The group is mounted under `/admin`, so the CDR's coarse RBAC classes every
//! call here as admin work: every scene signs in as the ADMIN dev user.
//!
//! Isolation: every fixture subscription is removed over the admin API before
//! AND after the scene that owns it, so a shared stack is left exactly as it
//! was found.
