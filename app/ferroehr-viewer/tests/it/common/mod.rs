//! Shared E2E journey harness: env-gated `WebDriver` setup (skip-with-reason
//! when the stack isn't up), step screenshots, explicit waits, and the
//! standing browser-console gate — every journey fails on any console
//! error (the cheapest hydration-bug detector).
//!
//! Two lanes drive this harness, and they are not equals. The IMAGE lane is
//! the authoritative one: it runs the shipped OCI artifact, whose WASM is the
//! release build. The HOST lane serves a debug-profile WASM bundle an order of
//! magnitude larger, trading hydration latency for compile speed so a change
//! can be driven in seconds — which is why [`Harness::wait_hydrated`] carries
//! its own, far longer budget than the element waits around it.
