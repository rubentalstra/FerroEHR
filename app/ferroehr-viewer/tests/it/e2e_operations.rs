// e2e journeys are assertive by design; skip-with-reason prints; the shared
// harness module is per-test-binary (the corpus.rs test-file precedent)
//! End-to-end journeys over the console's **operations panel** (`/operations`):
//! the dependency-health card over the CDR's public readiness probe, the build +
//! spec provenance card, the metric registry browser, and the live log-filter
//! control (apply → assert effective → reset).
//!
//! The whole panel is probe-gated on the CDR serving its management surface, so
//! these journeys run against the composed stack, whose `docker/ferroehr.dev.toml`
//! enables it (`info`/`metrics` at `private`, `env`/`loggers` at `admin_only`).
//! The hidden-when-absent half cannot be shown on this stack (it always runs
//! management-ENABLED) and is unit-tested in `ferroehr_viewer::management`
//! against a probe that found no surface — the same split as the admin-group
//! journeys.
//!
//! Isolation: the log-filter journey restores the CDR's boot filter as its final
//! step, so it leaves the stack exactly as it found it for every later journey
//! and for the documentation-screenshot pass.
