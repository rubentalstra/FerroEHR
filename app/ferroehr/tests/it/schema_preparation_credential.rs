//! Schema preparation under the separated-credential posture: which
//! credential [`ferroehr::db::prepare`] runs each half on, and what an
//! operator is told when it is the wrong one.
//!
//! These tests run the REAL boot sequence — the pools the binary opens, then
//! `db::prepare` over them — rather than assembling a router over a database
//! something else already migrated. That distinction is the whole point of
//! the module: preparation spans every schema (the DDL of all five migration
//! sets under `apply`, all five `_sqlx_migrations` bookkeeping tables under
//! `verify`), while each runtime credential of the documented posture holds
//! exactly one pseudonymisation domain, so a test that never boots cannot see
//! the failure at all.
//!
//! NOTE: no openEHR spec governs migration mechanics or database roles — our
//! own design/extension (GDPR Art. 4(5) and Art. 32(1)(a); the migrations
//! carry the derivation).
