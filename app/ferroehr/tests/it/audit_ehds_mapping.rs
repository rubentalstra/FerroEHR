//! The EHDS Annex II 3.2 logging elements, asserted against the access-event
//! model and against BOTH renderings the audit trail leaves the server in.
//!
//! Annex II 3.2 of Regulation (EU) 2025/327 lists five things the European
//! logging software component must record "on every access event or group of
//! events" (<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/327/oj>). The published
//! mapping from each of them to a field lives on the audit page of the
//! documentation site; this module is what stops that page from becoming a
//! claim nobody checks.
//!
//! Three of the five are recorded and rendered, one is partial, and one is a
//! gap. **The gap is asserted as a gap**: a test that expects the absence
//! fails the day the field arrives, which is the point — the page and the
//! code then have to move together, and a gap cannot quietly close while the
//! documentation still calls it open. Where a rendering cannot carry an
//! element its FORMAT does not define, that absence is pinned too.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs the read-side access log — our own
//! design/extension. openEHR specifies the write-side `AUDIT_DETAILS` only
//! (`docs/specs/openehr/RM/docs/common/` §`AUDIT_DETAILS` Class).
