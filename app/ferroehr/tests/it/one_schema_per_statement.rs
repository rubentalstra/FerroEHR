//! No SQL statement this crate emits names relations of two storage domains.
//!
//! The domains are separated by schema, and the ONLY thing that selects one is
//! the pool's `search_path` ([`ferroehr::db::domain::Domain::search_path`]), on
//! which no other domain's schema ever appears. A statement can therefore reach
//! across the boundary in exactly one way: by schema-qualifying a relation of a
//! domain other than the pool's. That is what this suite refuses.
//!
//! It reads the crate's own sources rather than a running database, because the
//! property is about the statements that EXIST, not about the ones a particular
//! test happens to execute: a cross-domain join written into a rarely-taken
//! branch would pass every behavioural test and still be the defect. Once a
//! domain is relocated to a database of its own the statement would fail at
//! runtime, and a failure at that point is a served request that errors rather
//! than a build that refuses.
//!
//! NOTE: no openEHR spec governs schemas or database roles — our own
//! design/extension (GDPR Art. 4(5) and Art. 32(1)(a);
//! <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj>).
