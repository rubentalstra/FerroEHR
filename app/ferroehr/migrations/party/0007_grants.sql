-- party: the grants over the finished relations, and the reciprocal revokes
-- that make the domain boundary hold in both directions.
--
-- This set runs after the clinical one, so it is the first place a REVOKE can
-- name both schemas. The revoke is not redundant with never having granted: an
-- earlier blanket grant may exist and PUBLIC holds privileges by default on
-- some object kinds (PostgreSQL 18, GRANT, "Notes",
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-grant.html).
--
-- The sealed identifier store is narrower still: only the party writer reaches
-- the ciphertext, and the party READER holds every column but that one, so a
-- reporting role cannot read sealed values it has no business decrypting.
--
-- No openEHR spec governs database grants: our own operational design.
--
-- Runs with search_path = party, ext, public.
