-- party: the domain's own multimedia blob reference index.
--
-- A party body carries `DV_MULTIMEDIA` like a clinical one — a photograph on a
-- PERSON, a scanned document on an ORGANISATION — so the same externalization
-- and the same garbage collection reach this domain, and the index the
-- collector reads must live here rather than in the clinical schema: a row
-- naming a party's versioned object in the clinical schema would put a
-- demographic identifier where the clinical role can read it (GDPR Art. 4(5),
-- docs/law/eu/gdpr/text.html).
--
-- The table is the clinical `blob_ref` relation, same shape and same foreign
-- key, so one write path serves both domains. Our own extension — no openEHR
-- spec governs multimedia offload.
--
-- Runs with search_path = party, ext, public.

COMMENT ON TABLE blob_ref IS 'Which stored party version references which externalized multimedia blob, so blob garbage collection is a lookup rather than a scan of node. The clinical relation''s twin, because a blob shared with a party must survive the deletion of the clinical record that also referenced it. Our own extension.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN blob_ref.uri IS 'The referenced blob''s URI, as the stored body spells it.';
