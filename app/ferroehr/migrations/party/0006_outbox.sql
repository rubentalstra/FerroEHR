-- party: the domain's own transactional change-event outbox.
--
-- The clinical outbox cannot serve it: that table's foreign key points at the
-- clinical contribution relation, and a party commit does not live there — so
-- a party commit would either violate that key or leave the domain, which is
-- what the separation removes. Written in the same transaction as the commit
-- it announces, exactly as the clinical one is; the envelope is PHI-free by
-- construction (the contribution id, a NULL EHR id, the per-version kind and
-- change type), so pseudonymisation is not weakened by announcing that a party
-- changed.
--
-- The erasure tombstone is the one row that announces no commit. A physical
-- party delete appends it in the same transaction as the delete, and every
-- consumer that derived anything from that party applies it by deleting what
-- it derived: GDPR Art. 19 makes the controller communicate an erasure "to
-- each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed"
-- (docs/law/eu/gdpr/text.html Art. 19). It carries no contribution, because
-- the contributions of that party are gone with it.
--
-- No openEHR spec governs eventing: our own extension.
--
-- Runs with search_path = party, ext, public.
