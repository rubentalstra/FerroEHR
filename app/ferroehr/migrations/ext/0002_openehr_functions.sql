-- ext: the openEHR value helpers the AQL emitter and the node decomposer call.
--
-- No openEHR spec governs storage helpers: our own design. What they compute is
-- spec-grounded — the ordered magnitude of a DV_ORDERED (RM data_types
-- master06-quantity_package.adoc) and the ISO 8601 date/time/duration forms
-- openEHR uses (BASE foundation_types master06-time_types.adoc and the
-- Iso8601_date / Iso8601_date_time class tables under BASE docs/UML/classes/) —
-- but nothing in openEHR says a database should carry them.
--
-- ONLY THE TWO PARSERS TRAP AN ERROR, and only because the trap measured
-- cheapest there. The documentation is direct about what a trap costs: "A block
-- containing an EXCEPTION clause is significantly more expensive to enter and
-- exit than a block without one. Therefore, don't use EXCEPTION without need."
-- (PostgreSQL 18, "Control Structures" §Trapping Errors,
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/plpgsql-control-structures.html). A helper
-- is read once per candidate row per AQL predicate, so a per-call subtransaction
-- is a cost worth removing, and five of the seven helpers remove it: every cast
-- they run is reachable only through a guard that proves it cannot raise. The
-- two whose whole body is "parse a date or a time" measure the other way —
-- PostgreSQL's own parser inside a trap validates more cheaply than any guard
-- that would let the same cast run untrapped — so openehr_date_days and
-- openehr_timestamp keep theirs and carry the measurement in their own comment.
-- A value any helper refuses reads as NULL — a comparison miss, never an error
-- the caller sees as a 500.
--
-- Those guards are ordered, never conjunctions: SQL fixes no evaluation order
-- between the operands of AND (PostgreSQL 18, "Expression Evaluation Rules",
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-expressions.html), so a cast is only
-- ever reached from inside a CASE arm or a nested IF whose condition has
-- already proved it safe.
--
-- LANGUAGE IS A MEASURED CHOICE PER HELPER, not a house style. A `LANGUAGE sql`
-- body folds into the calling query, which removes the call but substitutes the
-- argument expression at every parameter reference; a PL/pgSQL body reads its
-- argument into a local variable once but is always a call. Which wins depends
-- on how many times the body reads its input, so each helper ships in the form
-- that measured faster over a 50 000-row corpus of the values it actually sees:
-- `sql` for the four that read their input once or twice, `plpgsql` for the
-- three date/time parsers that read it many times over. The corpus test pins
-- the results, not the languages.
--
-- The PL/pgSQL bodies SCHEMA-QUALIFY every helper they call. PL/pgSQL resolves
-- function names at execution time against the caller's search_path
-- (PostgreSQL 18, "Writing SECURITY DEFINER Functions Safely",
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-createfunction.html), so an
-- unqualified call can be captured by a schema the caller put first; the
-- `LANGUAGE sql` bodies bind at definition time and need no such care.
--
-- Volatility is unchanged from the first generation, and it is load-bearing:
-- the parsers and ext.openehr_magnitude are IMMUTABLE, so they are legal in an
-- index expression, while ext.openehr_timestamp is STABLE because its
-- offset-less reading depends on the session TimeZone — "a function that
-- manipulates timestamps might well have results that depend on the TimeZone
-- setting. For safety, such functions should be labeled STABLE instead."
-- (PostgreSQL 18, "Function Volatility Categories",
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/xfunc-volatility.html).
--
-- Runs with search_path = ext.

-- The numeric value of a canonical JSON number's text.
--
-- substring() with a pattern yields NULL when the pattern does not match, so
-- the guard and the extraction are the same operation and the parameter is read
-- once, which is what lets this fold into its caller for free. The accepted
-- shape is JSON's own number grammar (RFC 8259 §6,
-- https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259#section-6) plus the leading minus.

-- Days since 0001-01-01 for an ISO 8601 date in either format.
--
-- BASE foundation_types master06-time_types.adoc admits reduced precision down
-- to the year, so `YYYY` and `YYYY-MM` read as the first month and first day;
-- removing the hyphens folds the extended format (`YYYY-MM-DD`, the form BASE
-- calls preferred) onto the basic one, so one reading serves both.
--
-- PL/pgSQL, because the reading looks at its input several times and a folded
-- body would re-evaluate the caller's jsonb extraction once per look.
--
-- THE CALENDAR IS LEFT TO make_date() INSIDE AN ERROR TRAP, which is the one
-- place in this file where a trap is the cheapest validator: over 50 000 date
-- readings this body measures 58 ms, against 61 ms for the first generation and
-- 65 ms for the same body checking the month, the day and the Gregorian leap
-- rule itself so the cast can run untrapped. The subtransaction the trap enters
-- is real (PostgreSQL 18, "Control Structures" §Trapping Errors,
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/plpgsql-control-structures.html); doing
-- its work by hand costs more.
--
-- The one thing the trap cannot do is refuse what PostgreSQL's integer input
-- accepts and ISO 8601 does not: text::integer skips leading whitespace and
-- accepts a sign, which read `  12` and `+2021-01-02` as years. One translate()
-- proves the fields are digits before the cast — what it leaves after removing
-- digits is empty only when every character was one.
--
-- The calendar goes through make_date() rather than a date cast because this
-- helper is IMMUTABLE and index-legal: the date input function reads the
-- session DateStyle (`01-02-2021` is January under MDY and February under DMY),
-- and "a function that manipulates timestamps might well have results that
-- depend on the TimeZone setting. For safety, such functions should be labeled
-- STABLE instead." (PostgreSQL 18, "Function Volatility Categories",
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/xfunc-volatility.html). make_date() takes
-- integers and reads no setting.

-- Seconds since the start of the day for an ISO 8601 time, ignoring any zone
-- suffix — the caller applies the offset through openehr_tz_offset_seconds.
--
-- PL/pgSQL for the same reason as the date reading. The `T` designator and the
-- zone suffix are cut positionally rather than by substitution, and the two
-- field forms BASE foundation_types master06-time_types.adoc defines are split
-- on whether a colon is present: the basic `hhmmss` (which needs a length above
-- two, or `hh` would read as the first field of the extended form) and the

-- decimal point, which is the fractional second the same section allows on the
-- last field; fields the input omits read as zero, which is the reduced
-- precision it also admits.
--
-- Each field's guard is folded into the one expression that computes the
-- reading, because a PL/pgSQL statement costs more than the operators inside
-- it: as twelve statements this reading measured 128 ms per 50 000 values,
-- against 118 ms for the first generation's trapped body; as four statements it
-- measures 95 ms. A CASE evaluates its WHEN before its ELSE, so the casts stay
-- unreachable until the guard has passed — the ordering the head of this file
-- requires. An absent field indexes past the array and reads as NULL, which the
-- guard's comparisons propagate rather than accept.

-- A total ISO 8601 text -> timestamptz reading.

-- orderings extract through it (app/ferroehr/src/aql/sql/value.rs,
-- Coercion::Temporal), so the promoted fast path and the jsonb lowering cannot
-- disagree.
--
-- Two readings. The first is PostgreSQL's own date/time input, which reads
-- every full-precision form correctly and far more cheaply than a decomposition
-- can, INSIDE AN ERROR TRAP: over 50 000 date-time readings this body measures
-- 70 ms, against 104 ms for the first generation and 235 ms for the same
-- readings with the fields and the calendar checked by hand so the cast can run
-- untrapped. The subtransaction the trap enters is real (PostgreSQL 18,
-- "Control Structures" §Trapping Errors,
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/plpgsql-control-structures.html); doing its
-- work by hand costs more. What the trap cannot decide is which spellings count
-- as a date-time: PostgreSQL also reads `now`, `today` and `2021-1-2`, and none
-- of those is a form openEHR defines, so the cast is reached only through two
-- LIKE patterns pinning the separator positions of the extended and the basic
-- format. A value the cast then refuses falls through to the second reading,
-- which is what the first generation did too.
--
-- The second reading completes reduced precision, which the cast cannot read at
-- all: a partial date assumes the first month and day, a partial time assumes
-- zero, and a time-only value anchors on 0001-01-01 — the same floor
-- openehr_date_days and openehr_time_seconds document. Mixed-precision ordering
-- is genuinely unspecified upstream, and the floor is our own recorded
-- semantics that does not depend on its resolution.
--
-- The offset-less reading takes the session TimeZone, spelled as AT TIME ZONE
-- over current_setting('TimeZone') rather than a cast, so the completion is one
-- expression with the local timestamp read once.
--
-- STABLE, never IMMUTABLE, and both readings need it: the cast reads the
-- session TimeZone and DateStyle, and the completion reads the TimeZone —
-- "a function that manipulates timestamps might well have results that depend
-- on the TimeZone setting. For safety, such functions should be labeled STABLE
-- instead." (PostgreSQL 18, "Function Volatility Categories",
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/xfunc-volatility.html). That is also why
-- this helper is not legal in an index expression, while the parsers above are.
--
-- Malformed input returns NULL — a comparison miss, never an error. Input that
-- is not ISO 8601 at all, including the words PostgreSQL's own parser accepts
-- (`now`, `today`, `infinity`), is malformed here: a stored value must not read
-- as the current time.
