-- Tamper evidence for the local IHE ATNA Audit Record Repository, plus the
-- least-privilege grants that make the `audit` schema usable by a role that
-- holds no DDL rights.
--
-- NOTE: no openEHR spec governs audit storage mechanics or database roles —
-- our own design/extension. The control being implemented is the OWASP
-- Logging Cheat Sheet's §Log Integrity ("build in tamper detection so you
-- know if a record has been modified or deleted") and the ATNA posture that
-- the audit trail is the node's accountability artifact.
--
-- The mechanism is an unkeyed SHA-256 hash chain maintained INSIDE the
-- database, so every writer is covered — the per-event INSERT, the batched
-- drain INSERT, and any statement issued by hand. Each row stores the hash of
-- its predecessor (`prev_hash`) and a digest over its own immutable content
-- including that link (`row_hash`); a single-row `audit_chain_state` carries the
-- chain head, and `audit_chain_gap` records every span retention reaped.
-- Verification (`audit.verify_audit_chain()`) recomputes every digest, re-walks
-- every link, and checks the end against the head, so a modified record, a
-- deleted record, and a truncated head or tail are each named — while a gap
-- retention actually produced is recognized as legitimate.
--
-- A per-record signature over the existing PGP signer was the alternative, and
-- it was rejected on both halves of the requirement: an independent signature
-- proves a record was not MODIFIED but says nothing about one that was
-- DELETED, and it would put an asymmetric operation on every audit write and
-- reach only records written by this server. Measured write-path cost of the
-- chain on PostgreSQL 18: ~0.28 ms per record on the batch path, no quadratic
-- term.
--
-- What it does NOT prove: the chain is unkeyed, so a party that can write
-- freely to this schema can delete a record and recompute every hash after it.
-- The controls for that case are the least-privilege grants below (the runtime
-- role can insert and stamp delivery, and nothing else) and the off-box copies
-- (RFC 5424 syslog, the ITI-20 ATX:FHIR feed) — the cheat sheet's "copy log
-- data to read-only media" control. Detection, not prevention.
--
-- Rows written before this migration are chained by the backfill below from
-- their stored order; the chain therefore attests them only from this point
-- forward.

-- ── the chain writer ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

-- The chain is written by three triggers, and the split is a throughput
-- decision rather than a stylistic one. Advancing the head by UPDATEing the
-- single state row PER RECORD costs quadratic time inside one transaction: each
-- update leaves another tuple version on the same page, and every subsequent
-- read walks the whole chain of them. Measured on PostgreSQL 18 over a 2000
-- record batch, that one statement was ~60% of the total insert time. So the
-- head is carried per STATEMENT in a transaction-local setting, and the state
-- row is read once at the start of a statement and written once at its end.
--
-- The setting is a cache, never an input: the BEFORE STATEMENT trigger
-- OVERWRITES it from the state row every time, so a caller who sets it by hand
-- has no effect on the chain a subsequent insert builds.
--
-- The FOR UPDATE on the state row is what makes the chain a total order:
-- concurrent inserting transactions serialize on it, and a rolled-back
-- transaction rolls its head advance back too, so chain_seq is gapless by
-- construction and a missing number means a deleted record.
--
-- SECURITY DEFINER on the two statement triggers so the runtime role can insert
-- records without holding any write privilege on the chain state (PostgreSQL 18
-- docs, CREATE FUNCTION §"Writing SECURITY DEFINER Functions Safely":

-- ── least-privilege grants ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

-- The `audit` schema had no grants at all, so the layered role architecture
-- (created by the ehr/ext baselines) could not reach it: only the owner could
-- write audit records. These grants give the runtime role exactly what the
-- server does — insert a record, stamp it delivered, read it back for ITI-81 —
-- and nothing that can rewrite or remove one.
