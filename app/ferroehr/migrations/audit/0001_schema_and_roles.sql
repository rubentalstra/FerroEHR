-- audit: the schema of the local IHE ATNA Audit Record Repository.
--
-- No openEHR spec governs audit storage mechanics: our own design/extension.
-- openEHR endorses in-system access logging and rules it OUT of the EHR
-- content — "read accesses by application users to EHR data should be logged
-- in the EHR system. ... currently openEHR does not support [logs as part of
-- the EHR proper]" (BASE architecture_overview/master07-security.adoc §Access
-- logging) — so this schema is strictly separate from the clinical one: no
-- foreign key into any EHR-content relation, no AQL visibility, never
-- versioned.
--
-- The record identifies the INSTANCE by the system id it carries in its FHIR
-- payload; there is no tenant column, because the instance is single-tenant
-- and isolation between organisations is a deployment property.
--
-- The roles are created by the ext set, which runs first. Runs with
-- search_path = audit, ext, public.
