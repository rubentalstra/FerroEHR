-- audit: the access-event fields, beside the ATNA record's own.
--
-- An ATNA record says who touched what. A care record's access log has to say
-- more: NEN 7513 lists the role or authority the person acted under; EHDS
-- Annex II 3.2(e) asks for "the origin or origins of data" (Regulation (EU)
-- 2025/327, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/327/oj); and a purpose and
-- a legal basis are what make an access explicable at all. These columns carry
-- them.
--
-- The domain column names the pseudonymisation domain the access read or
-- wrote, so a reviewer can see which side of the boundary an operation
-- touched. `system` means no domain.
--
-- Two columns for the origins, because a set may be capped: `origins` holds up
-- to the cap the server records and `origin_count` the true number, so a
-- truncated record says it is truncated rather than claiming to be the whole
-- answer. A JSON array rather than text[] in each case: the batched write path
-- binds one array per column and unnests it, which an array of jsonb scalars
-- can express row by row and a two-dimensional text array cannot.
--
-- Append-only needs no new machinery: the BEFORE UPDATE trigger the tamper
-- chain installs compares the whole row as jsonb minus the two delivery
-- stamps, so these columns are covered by it the moment they exist.
--
-- No openEHR spec governs the read-side model: our own design/extension.
--
-- Runs with search_path = audit, ext, public.

    -- The pseudonymisation domain the operation read or wrote:
    -- `ehr` (clinical), `demographic` (parties), `linkage` (the resolve map),

    -- templates, stored queries, node management).
    ADD COLUMN domain       text,

    -- own allow-list. NULL when the caller declared none.

    ADD COLUMN legal_basis  text,

    -- set, the entry count of a search. NULL for an operation that serves no
    -- countable set.
    ADD COLUMN result_count bigint,
    -- The request correlation id (the `x-request-id` the response carries), so
    -- an access record joins to the request it belonged to.
    ADD COLUMN request_id   text;

-- NULL is a real answer on the three code columns and means "not recorded":
-- records written before this migration carry no domain, and inventing one for
-- them would be a guess about what a past operation touched.

-- NULL is a real answer and means "not recorded": a Basic-authenticated
