-- clinical: the grants over the finished relations.
--
-- One file per domain carries every grant, so the catalog sweep and the boot
-- gate have exactly one file to read per domain. Grants are explicit and
-- non-overlapping: the clinical roles hold this schema and nothing of the
-- party or linkage domains; the reciprocal revokes are issued by whichever
-- set runs last, because a REVOKE cannot name a schema that does not exist
-- yet, and the clinical set runs first.
--
-- No openEHR spec governs database grants: our own operational design.
--
-- Runs with search_path = clinical, ext, public.
