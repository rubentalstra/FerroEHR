-- clinical: the optional integrations' stores — the FHIR mapping registry and
-- the multimedia blob reference index.
--
-- Both are extensions with no openEHR spec behind them, kept in the clinical
-- schema because their rows are EHR-scoped and reached through the clinical
-- pool.
--
-- Where the FHIR R4 surface of a deployment lives — this product's `fhir`
-- feature or FerroBRIDGE's facade — is the owner decision #3386 records.
-- `fhir_mapping` is the mapping registry that surface reads.
-- TODO(#3386): fhir_mapping leaves with the FHIR facade if the owner's
-- decision moves it to FerroBRIDGE.
--
-- Runs with search_path = clinical, ext, public.

-- Which stored version references which externalized multimedia blob.
--
-- `DV_MULTIMEDIA` may carry its content by reference
-- (`docs/specs/openehr/RM/docs/UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.data_types.dv_multimedia.adoc`:
-- `uri` is a "URI reference to electronic information stored outside the
-- record as a file, database entry etc"), and the multimedia store holds those
-- bytes outside the database. Garbage collection after a physical delete
-- then has to answer "does any surviving version still reference this blob",
-- which a scan of every `node` row answers slowly and a lookup here answers as
-- an index probe. Our own extension — no openEHR spec governs multimedia
-- offload.
--
-- One row per (version, URI). The rows are written by the node write path, in
-- the same transaction as the nodes they describe, so the index is never
-- behind the content it indexes; and the foreign key below carries them across
-- the tier move and removes them with the version, so nothing else maintains
-- them.

    -- key's ON UPDATE CASCADE, exactly as `node` is.
