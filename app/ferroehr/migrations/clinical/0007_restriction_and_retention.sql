-- to record their ground, and so the retention question has an answer path;
-- the read-path and write-path behaviour that consults them is separate work.
-- TODO(#3324): enforce restriction of processing on every read, write, export

-- TODO(#3346): serve the retention registers — the due view, the jurisdiction
-- defaults and the audit-domain ceiling.

-- No openEHR spec governs restriction of processing or retention: our own

-- Art. 18 (restriction of processing), Art. 5(1)(e) (storage limitation) and
-- Art. 30(1)(f) (the envisaged erasure periods in the record of processing
-- activities), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj. Note what the
-- openEHR side does NOT provide: EHR_STATUS.is_queryable is not a restriction
-- mark — RM ehr master04-ehr_package.adoc §EHR Status limits it to population
-- queries.
