-- linkage: the one cross-reference relation — which party, and which subject
-- identifier, name which EHR, temporally.
--
-- This is the SM's EHR Index (SM openehr_platform master02-overview.adoc: "EHR
-- Index | EHR id / demographic subject cross-reference service"; the operations
-- are I_EHR_INDEX). master07-ehr_index_service.adoc §Overview says why the
-- relation belongs here rather than in the clinical schema: "In a
-- privacy-supporting environment, this enables EHRs to be persisted with only
-- an EHR id; the EHR Index has to be used to obtain the subject identifier,
-- which will usually be used as a key into a demographic or MPI service".
--
-- Identifiers and the SM's own association metadata only — no name, no address,
-- no plaintext national identifier — because a row here is already the
-- additional information that re-joins a record to a person (GDPR Art. 4(5),
-- https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj), and adding an attribute would
-- make it identifying on its own.
--
-- A row names a party, a subject identifier, or both:
--
--   * party_id + ehr_id            — the demographic party is the subject of
--                                    the EHR (opened by the linkage service).
--   * subject_id + ehr_id          — an EHR Index association (I_EHR_INDEX),
--                                    carrying RESOURCE_STATUS and LOCATION_DESC.
--   * party_id + subject_id + ehr_id — both, once the party's server-minted
--                                    pseudonym has been written onto EHR_STATUS.
