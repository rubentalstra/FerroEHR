-- node: the decomposed content of every version, one row per RM structure
-- node, nested-set indexed.
--
-- RENDERED FROM app/ferroehr/migrations/templates/node.sql.in by
-- crate::storage::ddl_template. Both pseudonymisation domains carry the same
-- node relation, so one template renders both and neither can drift from the
-- other; edit the template, never this file.
--
-- Decomposing RM containment into rows rather than storing each versioned
-- object as one physical document is explicitly sanctioned by the RM, not
-- merely unaddressed by it — RM common master06-change_control_package.adoc
-- §Overview, of the containment its own figure draws: "Although the figure
-- implies physical containment of Versions by a Versioned object, this is only
-- one possible implementation. Other implementations (e.g. using orthodox
-- relational structures) might use references, separate compressed copies, or
-- any other mechanism." The column set, the nested-set interval and the
-- promoted predicate columns are our own storage design.
--
-- The interval (num, num_cap) is what makes AQL CONTAINS an integer range join
-- rather than a JSON walk (QUERY master03-syntax.adoc §Containment). The promoted
-- name_code and name_terminology columns are what make the AQL node predicate
-- `[atNNNN, 'text']` and its coded form answerable without a JSON probe
-- (master03 §Node predicate).
--
-- Runs with the domain's own search_path, so every relation below is created
-- and referenced unqualified.
