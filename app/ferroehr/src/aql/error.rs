//! AQL planner errors.
//!
//! Two families, both surfaced before any SQL is built:
//!
//! * [`AqlFeatureError`] — the feature-envelope rejections. Every variant names
//!   the rejected construct and cites the governing QUERY 1.1 spec section, so a
//!   rejection is always explainable against the vendored spec
//!   (`docs/specs/openehr/QUERY/docs/AQL/`), which is the ONLY authority for the
//!   accept/reject envelope: a construct the released QUERY 1.1 text defines is
//!   accepted or rejected on that text alone. Other implementations' envelopes
//!   are prior art and never widen or narrow this one.
//! * [`AnalysisError`] — path analysis / typing failures (unknown class or
//!   variable, unresolvable attribute, type mismatch, unbound parameter).
//! * [`SqlError`] — IR→SQL lowering failures (a construct the planner accepted
//!   but the SQL package cannot yet render), surfaced before execution.
//! * [`ExecError`] — execution / `RESULT_SET` assembly failures (a database
//!   error, a reassembly failure, or a projected version body outside the
//!   active `spec_profile`), surfaced during execution.
