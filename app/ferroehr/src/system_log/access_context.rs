//! The audit middleware stamps the declared purpose onto the records IT

//! boundary crossing, which no HTTP operation id describes — is built where
//! the request headers are already gone. This carries that one fact across, by
//! the same means [`crate::service::committer`] carries the authenticated
//! committer: a task-local the adapter publishes for the request's scope.
//!
//! The value is the code the deployment's own `[audit] purpose_codes`
//! vocabulary accepted, never a caller's free text, because the adapter has
//! already filtered it ("an unagreed string in the trail reads at review time
//! as though a purpose was established when none was").
//!
//! **No openEHR spec governs this — our own design/extension.** The purpose of
//! use is required of an access record by NEN 7513 and EHDS Art. 9, not by
//! openEHR.
