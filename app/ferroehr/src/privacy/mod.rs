//! The clinical-side data-minimisation policy: what content the `ehr` domain
//! refuses to hold.
//!
//! **No openEHR spec governs this — our own design/extension.** The RM makes
//! the room for it and points the same way: an EHR carries its subject as a
//! `PARTY_SELF` whose optional `external_ref` is a `PARTY_REF` into a
//! demographic service and nothing else identifying (RM ehr
//! `UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.ehr.ehr_status.adoc` §Attributes; RM common
//! `UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.common.party_self.adoc`), and
//! `PARTY_IDENTIFIED` says of itself "Should not be used to include patient
//! identifying information", a sentence the same paragraph scopes: the class
//! covers a party "other than the subject of the record", with health care
//! providers as its typical case (RM common
//! `UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.common.party_identified.adoc` §Description).
//! Neither is a machine-checkable rule, so this module is where FerroEHR makes
//! them ones. The legal ground is GDPR Art. 4(5) and Art. 25(2)
//! (<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj>) with the Dutch UAVG
//! Art. 46 and the Wabvpz over the BSN specifically
//! (<https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940>,
//! <https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0023864>).
//!
//! Three rules, all evaluated over the canonical JSON of a clinical commit
//! body before it is stored:
//!
//! 1. **The subject reference.** `EHR_STATUS.subject.external_ref` must name a
//!    configured pseudonym namespace and carry a UUID. In force only once the
//!    deployment declares its namespaces
//!    ([`config::PrivacyConfig::subject_namespaces`]).
//! 2. **Identified parties.** In clinical content a `PARTY_IDENTIFIED` may
//!    carry `name` and `identifiers` — the class is explicitly the provider
//!    proxy, "other than the subject of the record", whose paradigm case is
//!    "name and provider number of an institution" — and so may a
//!    `PARTY_RELATED`, unless its relationship codes `self`, where the party
//!    IS the subject and both are refused. The deployment can opt in to the
//!    `self` case. `Basic_validity` is satisfied by `external_ref` alone, so
//!    the refused proxy stays expressible; a subject's identifier VALUE is
//!    the scanner's job (rule 3) wherever it sits.
//! 3. **The identifier scanner.** No string leaf may carry a value one of the
//!    active identifier rules claims. The rules are keyed by jurisdiction and
//!    each transcribes the checksum its own issuing register publishes; a
//!    deployment selects which are active and adds patterns for the local
//!    kinds no build can ship a rule for ([`detect`]).
//!
//! A finding never carries the offending VALUE, only its RM path and the rule
//! that matched: a refusal travels into an error body, an access log and a
//! trace, and echoing a national identifier into all three to complain about it
//! would be the leak the rule exists to prevent.
