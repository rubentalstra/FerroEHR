//! The identifier ruleset: one named rule per national personal-identifier
//! kind, plus the patterns a deployment supplies for its own local ones.
//!
//! **No openEHR spec governs any of this — our own design/extension.** openEHR
//! is deployed across many jurisdictions, so the scanner is keyed by
//! jurisdiction rather than built around any one country: a rule is a named
//! kind carrying its own shape and, where the issuing register defines one, its
//! own checksum. Every shipped checksum is transcribed from the register that
//! issues the number, cited on the rule; a kind whose current algorithm could
//! not be established from its own register is NOT shipped, because a rule that
//! guesses is worse than an absent one — it tells an operator their data was
//! scanned.
//!
//! Collisions are a property of each rule, stated on each rule. A checksum over
//! a digit run of a fixed length accepts a fraction of random runs by chance,
//! and clinical content is full of numbers, so a rule narrows itself with
//! whatever structure it actually has (two control digits, an embedded date, a
//! non-numeric token shape) and the caller skips the RM slots whose value space
//! is machine codes ([`super::TERMINOLOGY_CODE_KEY`]).
