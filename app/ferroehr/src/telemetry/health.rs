//! Health indicators + registry + the readiness-aggregation semantics.
//!
//! A [`HealthIndicator`] is a named, async, bounded check (e.g. "ping the DB").
//! This module owns the trait, the registry, and the aggregation rules; the
//! concrete indicators live in [`crate::telemetry::indicators`] and the HTTP
//! probe handlers in the protocol adapter (`ferroehr-rest`, the always-on
//! public `/health` family). The registry runs every indicator concurrently,
//! each bounded to [`CHECK_TIMEOUT`], so a wedged dependency cannot hang a
//! probe.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs health probes — our own operational design.
