//! Log-record integrity for the TEXT log formats: CR and LF inside a logged
//! record are neutralised, so no value that reaches a field can forge a second
//! log line.
//!
//! The OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet §Log Injection asks that event data have
//! "carriage return (CR), line feed (LF) and delimiter characters" sanitized
//! (<https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html>).
//! Three of the four sinks satisfy that by construction: the `json` format
//! escapes control characters, ATNA syslog framing is datagram- or
//! octet-counted, and the Audit Record Repository is parameterized SQL. The text
//! format does not: `tracing_subscriber`'s default field visitor renders a
//! `%`-sigil field and an interpolated event message verbatim, and a line break
//! is the record delimiter of a line-oriented log.
//!
//! The delimiters within a record cannot forge a record and are left alone;
//! escaping them would mangle every message. ANSI and C1 escapes are
//! `tracing_subscriber`'s own concern (`Writer::sanitizes_ansi_escapes`).
//! [`crate::telemetry::layers`] wraps only the `pretty` and `auto` text `fmt`
//! layer with [`LineSafe`], so a JSON record keeps its own single `\n` escape.
//!
//! A genuine line break in a value is escaped rather than dropped, so a
//! multi-line clinical text appears as `line one\nline two` on one physical
//! line with every character preserved. The cost is that a value that literally
//! contained `\` and `n` reads the same as an escaped break; the `json` format
//! keeps values byte-exact.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs logging — our own design/extension.
