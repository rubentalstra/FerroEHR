//! The `spec_profile` compatibility stamp and the read-time refusal it feeds.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs runtime specification-generation selection — our own
//! design/extension. The compatibility direction the design rests on IS
//! spec-governed: the openEHR release strategy
//! (<https://specifications.openehr.org/governance/release_strategy>) defines a
//! minor release as "significant additions that do not change the semantics of
//! the existing part of the release", so a body accepted by a RELEASED
//! generation stays acceptable to a later development generation — never the
//! reverse.
//!
//! Hence the asymmetry this module implements: a commit under the development
//! generations additionally asks the RELEASED generation's reader whether it
//! could read the same body, and stores the answer
//! (`vo_version.stable_compatible`). A deployment later configured to the
//! `stable` profile refuses to serve a version that answer says the released
//! generations cannot express, rather than serving a body it does not
//! implement or rewriting one it must not.
