//! Import: replaying received `ORIGINAL_VERSION`s into the local store as
//! `IMPORTED_VERSION`s.
//!
//! Spec: RM common `master06-change_control_package.adoc` §Copying / §Committal
//! and Audits. Each received original is committed locally wrapped in an
//! `IMPORTED_VERSION`, and the two acts are stored side by side exactly as
//! §Committal and Audits requires: "Both the contribution and `commit_audit` of
//! the latter object correspond to the local act of committal, while the
//! knowledge of the original Contribution and committal are retained inside the
//! wrapped `ORIGINAL_VERSION` instance."
//!
//! Concretely, per imported version row:
//!
//! * the LOCAL act — `contribution_id` (the one fresh import CONTRIBUTION),
//!   `audit_id` (its `AUDIT_DETAILS`: this server's `system_id`, the importing
//!   committer, the server-computed import instant, `249|creation|` per
//!   §Contributions "import of item"), and the wrapper's own `signature`;
//! * the FOREIGN act — the wrapped original's own `contribution` `OBJECT_REF`,
//!   `commit_audit` (with its source `time_committed`) and `signature`, held
//!   verbatim in `vo_version.wrapped_original`, beside its unchanged 3-part
//!   identity, `lifecycle_state`, data and `attestations` ("the
//!   `ORIGINAL_VERSION` instance is never modified", §Copying).
//!
//! Keeping the LOCAL act in the row's own audit is what makes §Copying's
//! chronology rule hold for this store: "the commit times always reflect the
//! local (more recent) act of committal, not the original committal … rather
//! than giving the illusion that recently copied Versions were there earlier
//! than the time of local committal" — so `VERSIONED_OBJECT.time_created`, the
//! `Last-Modified` header and every as-of-instant read are computed from the
//! import, never from the source system's clock.
