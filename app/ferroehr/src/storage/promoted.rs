//! The promoted-leaf registry.
//!
//! The single source of truth for which canonical leaves are lifted onto a
//! dedicated `node` column, so a hot AQL predicate / sort reads an indexed
//! column instead of re-extracting the value through a correlated subtree scan.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs storage columns or their derivation — our own design;
//! openEHR defines the language (QUERY master03), not how a leaf is physically
//! materialized.
//!
//! One registry drives both directions, so the write side and the read side can
//! never disagree on the mapping:
//! - **Write** ([`crate::storage::codec`] → [`extract`]): at decomposition time,
//!   for a versioned-object root, the raw leaf text is captured onto the row and
//!   written into the column ([`crate::storage::node_repo::write_nodes`]).
//! - **Read** (`crate::aql::sql::value`): a lowered `LeafPath` whose flattened
//!   attribute path equals a registry entry's `path` (and whose source is the
//!   matching versioned-object root) substitutes `node.<column>` for the
//!   correlated-subquery lowering.
//!
//! ## Invariant on `rm_type`
//!
//! A promoted leaf's value lives on the root node (`num = 0`) of its versioned
//! object and the column is populated only there. The read side identifies the
//! root by `rm_type`, so an entry's `rm_type` must occur only at `num = 0`, that
//! is, a versioned-object root that never nests inside its own tree.
//! `COMPOSITION`, `EHR_STATUS` and `EHR_ACCESS` satisfy this; `FOLDER` does not,
//! so a `FOLDER` leaf would need an explicit `num = 0` guard on the read side.
