//! The shared DDL template both pseudonymisation domains are rendered from.
//!
//! The clinical and party domains carry the same change-control and node
//! relations. The first storage generation built the second domain with
//! `CREATE TABLE … (LIKE …)`, which copies checks but neither unique indexes
//! nor foreign keys, so the twin silently lacked invariants the original had
//! and a column added later never reached it. Here one template renders both

//! rendered text and the committed files.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs storage layout — our own design/extension. What the
