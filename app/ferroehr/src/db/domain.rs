//! The storage domains: one schema, one `search_path`, one pool and one DSN
//! each.
//!
//! A pseudonymisation domain is only as separate as the weakest thing that
//! spans it. Schemas and grants separate it inside one database, but a
//! superuser, a base backup, WAL archiving and physical replication carry every
//! schema of a database together
//! (<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/backup-dump.html>), and the law asks for
//! a separation that can reach another machine: EPDV Art. 10 Abs. 1 lit. b
//! requires the data to be stored "von anderen Datenbeständen getrennt", DSV
//! Art. 4 Abs. 5 requires the log to be kept "getrennt vom System, in welchem
//! die Personendaten bearbeitet werden", and the RM reads the same way — the
//! identity cross-reference "could be located on different machines" (BASE
//! `architecture_overview/master07-security.adoc` §Anonymity).
//!
//! So each domain carries its own `[storage.<domain>]` DSN, defaulting to the
//! shared `[db].url`. The default is the co-located deployment, unchanged: one
//! database, four schemas, the reciprocal grants and the boot gate
//! ([`crate::db::verify_domain_isolation`]). A regulated deployment moves a
//! domain to its own database or cluster by editing one URL.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs schemas, pools or database roles — our own
//! design/extension.
