//! `PostgreSQL` bootstrap: connection settings, pool construction, and the
//! per-schema migration sequence.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs the persistence mechanism; the storage substrate is
//! our own PG18-native design. This module is the single place the rest of the
//! crate obtains a database handle. [`DbConfig`] (the `[db]` config section)
//! carries the shared DSN and the pool tuning; [`domain::StorageConfig`] (the
//! `[storage]` section) carries one DSN per storage domain, each defaulting to
//! the shared one. [`connect_domains`] opens the four pools
//! ([`domain::DomainPools`]) and [`prepare`] brings each database they reach to
//! the state this build requires — on the migration DSN
//! ([`DbConfig::migrate_dsn`]) for every domain that reaches the same database
//! it does, a credential a deployment may name because preparation spans every
//! schema of a database while each runtime credential holds one domain. The domains differ in the
//! `search_path` their connections carry, so one set of storage functions
//! serves them all. [`verify_domain_isolation`] is the boot gate that refuses
//! to serve when the runtime roles can read across those boundaries, when two
//! separately-configured domains turn out to authenticate as one role, or —
//! under `deployment_profile = "production"` — when a domain role is missing
//! altogether. The `sea-query` identifier vocabulary for the live schema lives
//! in [`iden`]. This is the defining module for the whole bootstrap surface,
//! with no re-exports.
