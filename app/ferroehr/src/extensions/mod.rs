//! The spec-homeless surface: deliberate local extensions.
//!
//! No openEHR specification governs anything in this module tree; every
//! submodule is our own design/extension. These are the features the `ferroehr`
//! binary offers that no openEHR spec requires or describes, consolidated in one
//! place so the spec-homeless surface stays visible and auditable.
//!
//! The no-spec-home finding is verified rather than assumed. The three openEHR
//! chapters that touch integration, deployment and security-of-access were
//! checked as the last possible spec home: master14 governs
//! archetype-to-archetype data conversion (`GENERIC_ENTRY` + `FEEDER_AUDIT`) and
//! not FHIR resources, message brokers or outbound emission; master13 is
//! informative deployment guidance prescribing no eventing, multi-tenancy or
//! blob offload; master07 governs the `EHR_ACCESS` object and
//! authn-at-deployment. The two places a submodule touches spec-defined data are
//! the FHIR connector's `FEEDER_AUDIT` builder and the multimedia offload's
//! `DV_MULTIMEDIA` rewrite, which carry their RM citations in [`fhir`] and
//! [`multimedia`].
//!
//! Every extension keeps two non-negotiables: each submodule doc comment carries
//! the explicit flag "no openEHR spec governs this — our own design/extension",
//! and the feature does nothing unless configuration enables it, so with its
//! gate off the commit and read paths are byte-identical to the no-extension
//! behaviour.
//!
//! | Submodule | Gate (config path, default off) |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`events`] | `events.enabled` |
//! | [`fhir`] | `fhir.api_enabled` (routes) / `fhir.outbound.enabled` (emitter) |
//! | [`multimedia`] | `multimedia.enabled` |
//! | [`tenancy`] + [`tenant_context`] | tenancy-resolution middleware (configured) |
