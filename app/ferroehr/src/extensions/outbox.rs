//! The outbox reader registry and the retention prune both domains share.
//!
//! **No openEHR spec governs eventing: our own design/extension.**
//! `event_outbox` has one drainer (the AMQP publisher, which stamps
//! `published_at`) and any number of cursor readers, each keeping a `last_seq`
//! high-water mark in `event_outbox_reader`. The prune deletes a published row
//! only once it is older than the retention window AND at or below every
//! active reader's cursor, in one statement, so a slow or paused reader never
//! loses rows (#3330). Which readers are active is reconciled from the
//! configuration at boot, so a reader that was switched off cannot hold the
//! outbox forever.
