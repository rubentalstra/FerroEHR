//! The declared deployment posture: what this deployment is allowed to hold,
//! and which separations it has actually made (#3226).
//!
//! FerroEHR has a set of properties a deployment either has or does not have:
//! separated database credentials, separated database clusters, a declared
//! subject pseudonym namespace, an audit trail with a durable sink, schema
//! preparation on its own credential. Every one is a configuration key an
//! operator can leave unset, and a deployment that quietly has none of them
//! looks, from its own logs and its own API, exactly like one that has all of
//! them. The top-level `deployment_profile` key gives the server a declared
//! posture: `production` refuses to start when a property is missing and not
//! explicitly accepted, `sandbox` says which are missing, loudly and on every
//! surface, so it cannot be mistaken for the other.
//!
//! **This is FerroEHR's own posture, not a legal requirement.** GDPR Art. 4(5)
//! asks that the additional information be "kept separately and … subject to
//! technical and organisational measures"
//! (<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj>), not that it sit on a
//! separate server; one cluster with separated schemas, roles and no role that
//! spans them is a defensible reading. Two clusters are materially stronger
//! all the same, because a superuser, an instance-wide point-in-time recovery
//! and a single compromise are bridges no grant can close, and that is a
//! choice a deployment should make deliberately. There is no `research`
//! value: the flag controls RIGOUR, not purpose, and EHDS Chapter IV secondary
//! use runs on real patient data under a data permit, which is production
//! rigour whatever it is for.
