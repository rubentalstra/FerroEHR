//! Authentication configuration (Basic + OAuth2/OIDC bearer).
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs authentication mechanics, ITS-REST leaving the scheme
//! open — our own design, with the IETF OAuth2/JOSE RFCs as the authority for
//! every rule enforced here. This is the `[auth]` section of the one server
//! configuration tree and carries no loader of its own.
//!
//! Secrets use the shared [`crate::config::secret::Secret`] newtype: a password
//! hash or HMAC secret deserializes from a plain string but never renders itself
//! (`Debug`, `/management/env` and `ferroehr config check` all show `***`). Each
//! secret key has a `*_file` sibling for file-based indirection, resolved by the
//! loader.
//!
//! Boot validation lives in [`AuthConfig::validate`] and
//! [`AuthConfig::require_mechanism`]: a configuration a resource server cannot
//! honour is refused at startup rather than degraded at the first request.
