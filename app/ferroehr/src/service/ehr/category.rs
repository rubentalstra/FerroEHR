//! `COMPOSITION.category` — the openEHR `composition_category` terminology
//! group, as named constants.
//!
//! Spec: RM composition `master05-composition_package.adoc` §COMPOSITION and
//! `RM/docs/UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.composition.composition.adoc` — `category`
//! is a `DV_CODED_TEXT` "coded by openEHR terminology group `composition
//! category`", and `is_persistent()` is defined as that code being the
//! `persistent` member. The wire form of the category is its **numeric group
//! code** (`431`, not the rubric `persistent`); the rubric is resolved from the
//! `openehr-term` bundle at the render edge, never hardcoded.
//!
//! This module is the composition-side sibling of
//! [`crate::versioning::lifecycle::state`]: membership questions still go
//! through the bundle (which is the authority), and the constants exist so no
//! read or write path ever spells a category code as a bare string literal.
//! `tests::category_group_is_the_expected_four_members` is the completeness
//! guard the `audit_change_type` and `version_lifecycle_state` constant sets
//! also carry — it fails if the TERM bundle's group ever gains or loses a
//! member, which is when this module needs a new constant.

/// The `composition_category` group members this chapter names.
