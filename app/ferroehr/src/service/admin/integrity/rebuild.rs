//! The node rebuild: the repair the storage-parity sweep had no counterpart
//! for.
//!
//! NOTE: no openEHR spec governs storage mechanics — our own design/extension;
//! the storage keeps a version's content twice, as `vo_version.body` and as the
//! decomposed `node` rows, and the sweep ([`super`]) reports where the two
//! disagree.
//!
//! Which copy is authoritative is not a choice this module makes, it is a
//! property of the storage: `body` is the version's canonical serialized form,
//! the bytes the digital signature was taken over (RM common
//! `master06-change_control_package.adoc` §Digital Signature) and the bytes a
//! point read serves; the node rows are a derived index over it, produced by
//! `crate::storage::codec::decompose`. So a disagreement is repaired in one
//! direction only — the rows are re-derived from the body — and a version whose
//! BODY is the damaged copy is refused rather than propagated into the index.
//!
//! Dump and load re-decomposes too, but cannot serve as the repair: its dump
//! side reads each version through `node_repo::read_version_canonical`, from
//! the node rows themselves, so it would reproduce exactly the damage it is
//! asked to fix. It is also a whole-repository round trip.
