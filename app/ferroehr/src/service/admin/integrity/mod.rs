//! The storage-parity sweep: the two stored copies of every version's content
//! are re-derived and compared.
//!
//! NOTE: no openEHR spec governs storage mechanics — our own design/extension;
//! the storage keeps a version's content twice, as `vo_version.body` (the
//! materialized projection point reads serve) and as the decomposed `node`
//! rows (the AQL index), and their equality is an invariant of the commit path.
//!
//! The read-time signature verification in `crate::versioning::integrity` covers
//! the `body` copy, recomputing at a point read the signature taken over the
//! version's canonical serialized form (RM common
//! `master06-change_control_package.adoc` §Digital Signature), and says nothing
//! about the `node` rows. This sweep reassembles each version from its node rows
//! and compares the result to the stored body, so a tampered or corrupt row in
//! either copy becomes visible.
//!
//! Reassembly is only half of it. Rows written by an OLDER decomposition still
//! reassemble into exactly their body: the same content, in a different shape.
//! A version whose rows agree is therefore decomposed a second time from its
//! body and the two row sets compared, which is what makes a release that
//! changes the decomposition an upgrade step an operator can run and verify.
//!
//! It runs off the request path on an administrator's call and reads every
//! stored version in both storage tiers. It never logs content; a mismatch is
//! reported by identifier alone.
