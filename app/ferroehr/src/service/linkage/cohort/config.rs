//! The `[cohort]` section — the allow-list of demographic predicates a cohort
//! query may select on, and the two limits that bound what it may serve.
//!
//! **No openEHR spec governs this — our own design/extension.** openEHR defines
//! no cross-domain cohort query: AQL runs over the clinical domain and knows
//! nothing of the demographic one, and the SM has no linkage component at all.
//! What this section states is which demographic leaves a deployment is willing
//! to have a cohort selected on, named by the archetype and at-code that carry
//! them — because that is a deployment fact about the archetypes in use, never
//! something a server can infer.
//!
//! The list is EMPTY by default, which leaves the surface off: a deployment
//! that has not stated what may be selected on has not decided, and a default
//! guess would be a selection criterion nobody chose.
//!
//! A field of the one config tree ([`crate::config::FerroEhrConfig`]); no
//! loader of its own.
