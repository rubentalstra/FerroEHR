//! Reading and writing `linkage.subject_ehr`, the one relation of the linkage
//! domain.
//!
//! **No openEHR spec governs the storage — our own design/extension.** The
//! relation carries two kinds of row and this module is the only writer of
//! either: the party-to-EHR mapping the linkage service opens, and the EHR
//! Index association the SM `I_EHR_INDEX` operations record
//! (`docs/specs/openehr/SM/docs/openehr_platform/master07-ehr_index_service.adoc`).
//! Keeping both behind one module is what lets [`super`] and
//! [`crate::service::ehr_index`] stay a service seam over a store rather than
//! two dialects of the same table.
//!
//! Nothing here deletes. Every statement is scoped to the rows IN FORCE
//! (`upper_inf`) except the closes, which is what turns an in-force row into a
//! historical one: a merge, a split or an index correction closes a period and
//! opens the next, so "which party was the subject of this EHR when that
//! composition was written" stays answerable (GDPR Art. 5(1)(d) accuracy is
//! served by correcting forward, not by erasing the record of what was
//! believed). The one destructive path is erasure, which the role cannot
//! perform itself: [`erase_ehr`] calls the `SECURITY DEFINER` function the
//! migration set defines for it.
//!
//! Every statement names its relations unqualified and resolves through the
//! linkage pool's `search_path`, which carries neither `clinical` nor
//! `party`. A statement here therefore cannot reach either domain even if it
//! tried.
