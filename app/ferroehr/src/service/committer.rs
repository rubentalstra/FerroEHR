//! The authenticated-committer request context.

//! Every CONTRIBUTION carries a committer (`AUDIT_DETAILS.committer` `1..1`,
//! RM common `master04-generic_package` §Audit Details): when a request is
//! authenticated, the audit is attributed to that principal; an internal or
//! unauthenticated write falls back to the system identity. The protocol
//! adapter publishes the identity for the request's task scope via
//! [`with_committer`] and the platform reads it via [`current_committer`] —
//! the transport (a task-local) is spec-silent: no openEHR spec governs this
//! — our own design.
