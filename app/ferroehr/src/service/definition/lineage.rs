//! The archetype specialisation-lineage index over the ADL2/OPT2 artefact
//! store — the read the AQL planner takes before lowering a query.
//!
//! AM `Identification` master07 §Supporting Archetype-based Querying: "for
//! specialised archetypes, the specialisation lineage can only be obtained from
//! the operational form of the archetype, found in the template used to create
//! the data". The `specialize` parent of every uploaded artefact is extracted
//! by the `openehr-adl` engine at validation time and stored alongside it
//! (`adl2_artefact.parent_hrid`), so resolving the lineage is one small indexed
//! read rather than a re-parse of every stored source.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs the caching — our own design/extension: the index is
//! memoised in-process so an AQL execution does not pay the read per query,
//! invalidated on every local artefact write, with a short time-to-live that
//! doubles as the convergence window for an upload made on another instance.
