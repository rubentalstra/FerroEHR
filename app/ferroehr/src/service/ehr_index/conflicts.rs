//! Design-filled advisory duplicate-detection read.
//!
//! `master07 §Overview` names two error states the index metadata exists "to
//! detect and rectify": multiple EHRs recorded for one subject, and multiple
//! subjects recorded for one EHR. The SM defines no detection *operation* —
//! this read is our own design (advisory, never a hard reject: the N:M states
//! are legal-but-flagged per `resource_instance_type.adoc` `Duplicate`).
//!
//! Both scans run on the linkage pool, over the associations in force.
