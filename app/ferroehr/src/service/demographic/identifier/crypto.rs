//! The cipher and the blind-lookup digest for protected national identifiers.
//!
//! **No openEHR spec governs this — our own design/extension.** The RM models
//! identifiers generically (`DV_IDENTIFIER`, RM `data_types`
//! `UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.data_types.dv_identifier.adoc`) and says
//! nothing about protecting the value. The obligations are external: GDPR
//! Art. 32(1)(a) names encryption as an appropriate measure
//! (<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj>), NEN 7510-2 carries the
//! cryptographic controls, and UAVG Art. 46 with the Wabvpz permit BSN
//! processing in care only for identification and under the act's conditions
//! (<https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940>,
//! <https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0023864>).
//!
//! Two primitives, because storage and lookup want opposite things:
//!
//! * **AES-256-GCM** over the identifier value, with a fresh 96-bit nonce per
//!   record. AES-GCM rather than ChaCha20-Poly1305 because NIST specifies it
//!   (SP 800-38D) and this control answers to reviewers who look for that;
//!   both are pure-Rust `RustCrypto` AEADs. The scheme code and the tenant are
//!   bound in as associated data, so a ciphertext moved to another scheme or
//!   another tenant fails to open rather than decrypting into the wrong
//!   meaning.
//! * **HMAC-SHA-256** over the value, as the blind-lookup column. Equality
//!   search needs a deterministic image of the value; a keyed digest gives one
//!   without letting the database, a backup or a replica reverse it, which an
//!   unkeyed hash of a nine-digit number would not (the whole space is
//!   enumerable in seconds).
//!
//! Keys are per DOMAIN and per tenant, derived from one configured root key by
//! HMAC-SHA-256 over a labelled context — the NIST SP 800-108 KDF-in-counter
//! construction with a single block, which is all a 256-bit subkey needs. One
//! key in configuration therefore yields a distinct cipher key and a distinct
//! lookup key per tenant, and a tenant's ciphertexts stay unreadable with
//! another tenant's subkey.
//!
//! The domain is bound in for the same reason the tenant is. The clinical and
//! demographic sides are separate pseudonymisation domains (GDPR Art. 4(5);
//! EDPB Guidelines 01/2025 §2), and a separation that holds in the schema and
//! in the database roles but shares one cipher key is one key disclosure away
//! from collapsing. With [`KeyDomain`] in the derivation context, a subkey
//! derived for the clinical domain cannot open a demographic record even when
//! both are derived from the same configured root — which is what makes a
//! per-schema backup a genuinely separate artefact rather than two files under
//! one key.
