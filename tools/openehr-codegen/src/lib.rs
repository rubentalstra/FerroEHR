//! `openehr-codegen` — generates the openEHR spec crates from the vendored BMM
//! meta-model, structured as a four-stage pipeline:
//! `load` → `analyze` → `plan` → `render`, driven by `cli` (private modules —
//! `cargo doc --document-private-items` renders them).
//!
//! The stages are library modules, not a binary-only tree, so the emitter's
//! invariants are tested as properties over the real pipeline on the real
//! vendored inputs (`tests/emitter_invariants.rs`) through [`testsupport`].
//!
//! Usage:
//!   `openehr-codegen check`          — load + validate the vendored BMM schemas.
//!   `openehr-codegen emit [OUTDIR]`  — emit Rust into the spec crates.
