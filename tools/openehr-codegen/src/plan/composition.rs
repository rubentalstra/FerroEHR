//! The **crate → generation table**: declarative data recording, per emitted
//! spec crate, the BMM GENERATIONS it carries — vendored input file, emitted
//! generation-module name, per-generation spec version, which generation is
//! CURRENT, and the dependency GENERATIONS each one resolves against. Each
//! entry carries the `includes` citation that justifies its composition.
//!
//! This is the single source of truth for what the generator emits. [`compose`]
//! resolves an entry into per-generation loaded schemas + resolution models +
//! the [`External`] full-path index the render stage consumes, so `cli.rs`
//! never hand-merges schemas — the membership is data, not control flow.
//!
//! One generation is one COMPONENT VERSION, emitted completely at its own
//! version-named top module (`v1_2`, `v2_4`, …) mirroring its source package
//! structure. A component version can publish several specification units
//! (LANG 1.1.0 publishes BMM v2.x beside BMM3); each unit is emitted completely
//! inside the one generation module and units are never merged into one class
//! map, because a merge picks one shape per colliding name and discards the
//! other's attributes. The prelude carries the CURRENT generation's stable
//! units; older generations are reached by full module path.
//!
//! NOTE: five classes are declared by BOTH the RM 1.2.0 and BASE 1.3.0 BMM with
//! different shapes, and both twins are emitted, because RM
//! `docs/common/master08-resource_package.adoc` retains its Resource package
//! "only while needed by AOM 1.4 based archetypes and tools" and BASE
//! `docs/foundation_types/master00-amendment_record.adoc` records SPECAM-82
//! adding a legacy `CODE_PHRASE` for the same reason.
//!
//! The RM twin's `TRANSLATION_DETAILS.accreditaton` spelling is an upstream
//! defect the emitter reproduces: SPECPUB-6 corrected the BASE copy alone.
