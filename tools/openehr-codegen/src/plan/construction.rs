//! The **construction-door** decision map: which generated spec classes hide
//! their fields behind a validating constructor, and which stay plain records.
//!
//! A spec class emits as a plain data record by default: every field `pub`,
//! construction by struct literal. A class gets [`Door::Validated`] instead
//! when the released spec states a constraint over its field values that is
//! DECIDABLE FROM THOSE FIELDS ALONE — a lexical form (BASE
//! `base_types/master05-identification_package.adoc` §Syntaxes gives an EBNF
//! grammar per identifier class) or a class invariant over its own fields (RM
//! `UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.common.item_tag.adoc` §Invariants states
//! `Inv_key_valid`/`Inv_value_valid` over `ITEM_TAG`). An invariant needing
//! anything the instance does not carry stays at the `Validate` tier.
//!
//! A validated class emits its fields `pub(crate)` plus read accessors, so
//! outside the defining crate the only construction path is the hand-written
//! `*_impl.rs` constructor, which every generated codec also routes through.
//! `pub(crate)` and not private because the grammar itself is hand-written
//! spec behaviour in a sibling module of the same crate.
//!
//! The map is exhaustive over the classes it names: a [`Door::PlainRecord`] or
//! [`Door::TierEnforced`] entry is a recorded decision, not an omission, and
//! extending the validated set is a per-class spec adjudication.
