//! JSON emitter: emits `impl serde::Serialize` + `impl serde::Deserialize` for
//! the generated spec types (BASE / RM / AM / TERM / LANG), into each spec
//! crate's own `src/json_serde.rs`, plus the `_type`-keyed structural dispatch
//! in `openehr-its`.
//!
//! Every fact comes from the BMM ([`Model::json_types`]); there is no XSD
//! input. The canonical-JSON wire shape is `_type` first, then BMM declaration
//! order, with absent rather than null or empty optional attributes
//! (`docs/specs/openehr/ITS-REST/specifications/docs/overview/Resources.md`
//! §JSON Format).
//!
//! The impls are written out by hand rather than derived because the canonical
//! wire is none of serde's four enum representations
//! (<https://serde.rs/enum-representations.html>): the discriminator is a member
//! of the object whose presence is context-dependent, it routes deep descendants
//! onto an intermediate variant, and the closed key set must be enforced beside
//! it (`deny_unknown_fields` is incompatible with `flatten`). Each class gets
//! the long form from <https://serde.rs/deserialize-struct.html>.
//!
//! They land in the crate that DEFINES each type, because both serde and the
//! spec types are foreign to `openehr-its` (orphan rule, E0117); that also lets
//! them construct through `pub(crate)` fields and the validated constructors
//! ([`construction`]).
//!
//! The read side is STRICT over the generated RM model at our pin: an undeclared
//! key, a repeated key and an absent mandatory attribute are all refusals (see
//! [`emit_struct_deserialize`] for the released grounding). Out-of-order
//! members, a missing `_type` on a concrete slot, `Option`/`Vec` defaulting and
//! the `Interval` literal defaults are all accepted.
