//! Source-text position arithmetic — one home for this generation's parsers.
//!
//! Every reader in the LANG family reports defects at a byte offset in the
//! source it was handed, and needs to present that offset to a human as a line
//! and column. Which readers a generation carries differs — Release-1.0.0
//! defines an ODIN-only grammar set, the 1.1.0 line adds BEL and the ADL/cADL
//! front end — but the mapping is a property of the TEXT, not of any one
//! grammar, so it lives here once rather than being re-derived per parser or
//! per generation.

/// The 1-based line and column of a byte `offset` in `src`, counting COLUMNS
/// IN CHARACTERS.
///
/// Columns count characters rather than bytes so a line of clinical text with
/// non-ASCII content reports the column an author sees in an editor. An offset
/// past the end of `src` clamps to the end, so a defect reported at
/// end-of-input still names a real position.
