//! Hand-written RM spec functions for `PATHABLE`.
//!
//! `PATHABLE` is abstract, so the generated `Pathable` is the closed subtype
//! enum over every pathable RM class, and the four resolvable functions it
//! declares are realized here. The pathing itself is NOT re-derived: it lives
//! once in [`crate::v1_2::paths`], over the canonical-JSON value tree, and a
//! typed value reaches it by encoding itself with this crate's own
//! canonical-JSON impls — so a typed path answer and a wire path answer cannot
//! differ.
//!
//! Spec:
//! `docs/specs/openehr/RM/docs/UML/classes/org.openehr.rm.common.pathable.adoc`
//! §Functions; the path grammar is BASE
//! `docs/specs/openehr/BASE/docs/architecture_overview/master11-paths.adoc`.
//!
//! Two of the six functions are NOT realized here, and the reason is the same
//! in both cases — a value alone is not the structure the function is defined
//! over:
//!
//! - `parent ()` is "the parent of this node in a compositional hierarchy",
//!   which §Description says "is defined as abstract in the model, and may be
//!   implemented in any way convenient". No RM attribute carries it, and this
//!   repository stores no owning back-references, so the parent is a
//!   root-anchored lookup ([`crate::v1_2::paths::parent_of`]) — it needs the
//!   enclosing structure, which a node does not hold.
//! - `path_of_item (a_loc)` is "the path to an item relative to the root of
//!   this archetyped structure", i.e. the path of a node that IS inside this
//!   structure. The primitive answering it
//!   ([`crate::v1_2::paths::path_of_item`]) locates that node by identity;
//!   two independently held typed values have no identity relation, and
//!   matching by equality instead would return the path of *an* equal node
//!   rather than the one asked about, which is a different question wherever a
//!   structure repeats a value.
