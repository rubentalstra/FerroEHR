//! The identifier readers, which parse bytes taken straight from the URL.
//!
//! Every versioned read addresses its object with a `{version_uid}` PATH
//! parameter, and `ferroehr_rest::overview::version_id::parse_version_uid`
//! hands that string to `ObjectVersionId::from_str` unmodified. So this is the
//! one parser family an unauthenticated caller reaches before any body is read,
//! any content type is negotiated, or any authorization runs — and a panic here
//! is not a `400`, it is a thread unwind on the request path.
//!
//! `OBJECT_VERSION_ID` is a COMPOSITE (BASE `base_types` master05 §Composite
//! Identifiers): `object_id::creating_system_id::version_tree_id`, where the
//! third part is itself dotted (`trunk.branch.branch_version`). Two separators
//! with different meanings and a nested grammar is exactly the shape where a
//! reader mis-slices, so the harness walks the parsed value's accessors rather
//! than stopping at "it parsed".
