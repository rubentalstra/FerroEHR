# Maintainers and access continuity

This file is the roster and the honest answer to the question an enterprise
procurement review asks about any software that holds patient data: *what
happens if the people who can ship a fix are unavailable?*

It is deliberately not aspirational. Everything below describes the project as
it is on the day you read it in git history, not a structure the project hopes
to grow into.

## Roster

| Person        | GitHub                                           | Role              | Since      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Ruben Talstra | [@rubentalstra](https://github.com/rubentalstra) | Maintainer (sole) | 2026-07-01 |

**The bus factor of this project is one.** There is exactly one person with
write access to the repository (`GET /repos/rubentalstra/FerroEHR/collaborators`
returns one login), one person who can publish a release, and one person who
can accept a pull request. No second maintainer exists, no organisation stands
behind the project, and no legal entity is a party to it.

Everything else in this file follows from that sentence, and no wording
elsewhere in the repository should be read as softening it. The path out is in
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md): becoming a maintainer is a defined route,
and it is open.

## Publishing identities and where they live

These are the credentials and configured identities that can put bytes in front
of a user. Naming them is the point: an inventory nobody has written down is an
inventory nobody can hand over.

| Identity                                     | What it publishes                                             | Held by                                                                                                                                                                | Recovery if the holder is unavailable                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The GitHub account `rubentalstra`            | everything: the repository, releases, issues, settings        | the maintainer                                                                                                                                                         | none: the repository is user-owned, so GitHub's account-recovery process is the only route, and it is between GitHub and the account holder                                                   |
| The OpenPGP commit- and tag-signing key      | the verified signature on every commit and every release tag  | the maintainer, on his own hardware                                                                                                                                    | none: the private key is not escrowed. A successor would publish a new key and re-establish trust from a signed statement on the repository; historical signatures stay verifiable regardless |
| crates.io Trusted Publisher (OIDC)           | the eight `openehr-*` crates                                  | configured per crate on crates.io against this repository, the `crates-io` environment, and both publishing workflows (`release.yml` and `publish-crates.yml` — Trusted Publishing matches the workflow filename) — **no long-lived token exists anywhere** | the crates.io owner list is the recovery surface, and it is the maintainer's account. A successor with repository write access can run the lane, but only after crates.io ownership moves     |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` (ephemeral, per workflow run) | the GHCR container images, the Helm chart, the GitHub release | GitHub, minted per run; nothing is stored                                                                                                                              | not applicable — there is no credential to lose                                                                                                                                               |
| The `FOSSA_API_KEY` repository secret        | nothing; it uploads a licence analysis                        | the repository                                                                                                                                                         | not applicable — a lost key costs a scan, not a release                                                                                                                                       |
| Zenodo                                       | the archived release deposit and its DOI                      | the Zenodo account linked to the GitHub account                                                                                                                        | tied to GitHub account recovery                                                                                                                                                               |
| The `ferroehr.eu` domain and GitHub Pages    | the documentation site                                        | the maintainer (registrar account)                                                                                                                                     | none: registrar account recovery only                                                                                                                                                         |

**The honest reading of that table:** with a single exception, every
publishing identity terminates at one person's GitHub account or one person's
hardware. Trusted Publishing removes the *stored secret* risk (there is no
crates.io token to leak), but it does not distribute the *authority*, which
is still one account's. That is the residual risk, and it is stated rather than
mitigated because no mitigation is currently available to a one-person project
without a legal entity behind it.

## If the maintainer is unavailable

There is no succession plan that a document can create. What exists instead:

- **Nothing already published disappears.** Releases are immutable and their
  assets stay downloadable; published crates cannot be unpublished (only
  yanked, which needs the owner anyway); published chart versions are never
  overwritten by policy and the lane refuses to; the Zenodo DOI is permanent.
  A deployment already running is not affected by maintainer availability.
- **Nothing new ships.** No release, no security fix, no chart version, no
  crate publish. The support window in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) (only the
  newest release is supported) becomes, in that situation, no supported
  release at all.
- **The work is not lost.** The licence is MIT, the history is public, every
  gate is a committed script and every design decision is in the tree or on
  the tracker. A fork is a complete and legitimate continuation, and the
  project's position is that it should be taken rather than waited on.
- **A vulnerability report has a fallback.** If a private report receives no
  acknowledgement within the window [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) commits to, the
  policy already tells you to escalate publicly, and publishing becomes your
  call. That path does not depend on the maintainer.

If you depend on this software in a clinical setting and that position is
not acceptable to you (it reasonably may not be), the mitigation is on your side
of the boundary: pin a version, keep a fork you can build, and budget for
maintaining it. That is a truthful answer, and it is more useful than a
continuity plan with nobody behind it.

## Adding a maintainer

The route is in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md). When someone takes it, this
file gains a row, [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) gains their handle
on the areas they own, and the table above gains a second holder wherever the
identity permits one. Those three edits are the whole mechanism.
