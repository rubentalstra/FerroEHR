# VEX statements

Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange documents, in [OpenVEX](https://openvex.dev)
format, asserting the exploitability of specific findings in the images this
project publishes.

A VEX document is not a way to silence a scanner. It is the machine-readable form
of an argument, and it carries the argument with it: each statement names the
vulnerability, the product, a `status`, a controlled-vocabulary `justification`,
and an `impact_statement` a reader can check. The alternative — an ignore list —
records the decision without the reasoning, which decays into a list nobody can
re-evaluate.

## Rules

- **`not_affected` needs a justification from the OpenVEX vocabulary**, and the
  `impact_statement` must say concretely why the code is unreachable in *our*
  usage. "Low risk" is not a justification.
- **A finding we can fix is fixed, not VEXed.** These documents exist for
  findings in inherited upstream layers, where the fix belongs to someone else.
- **Re-check on every base-image bump.** When an upstream image rebuilds its
  bundled binaries, statements about them become obsolete and the entries go —
  a stale `not_affected` is worse than no VEX at all.
- The scanners consume these files (`trivy --vex`), so a statement that stops
  being true stops being invisible: the finding returns and the gate fails.

## Documents

| File | Subject | Authored |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres-gosu.openvex.json` | Go standard-library advisories in `/usr/local/bin/gosu`, the privilege-dropping helper the upstream `postgres` image ships. Not reachable: gosu sets uid/gid and execs, opening no socket and parsing no untrusted input. | by hand |
| `rust-advisories.openvex.json` | The Rust dependency advisories: the five accepted by the advisory gate, plus the one a lock-file-reading scanner reports for a crate our feature set never compiles. | **generated** |

## The generated document

`rust-advisories.openvex.json` is produced by
`scripts/security/vex-generate.sh` from two inputs, and must never be edited by
hand:

- **`deny.toml`** `[advisories].ignore` — the authoritative set of advisory
  ids. It is the gate that actually decides whether a build passes, so it is
  the only place the id list may live.
- **`security/vex/rust-advisories.toml`** — the reasoning: the OpenVEX
  `status`, the controlled-vocabulary `justification`, and the
  `impact_statement` for each id.

Two lists that must agree is exactly the shape this repository has already been
bitten by (a second advisory ignore list at `.cargo/audit.toml` that nothing
read and that had drifted to a different set of ids). So the generator refuses
to emit anything unless the two sets match in **both** directions, and
`scripts/checks/vex-advisories.sh` — the `vex` CI job — regenerates the
document and fails on any difference. Adding an ignore to `deny.toml` without
publishing its justification is a red build, not an oversight nobody notices.

Agreement is not the same as truth, though: an ignore and its justification stay
in perfect agreement while a dependency upgrade quietly resolves the advisory
underneath both. `scripts/checks/advisory-exceptions.sh` (in the `cargo-deny` CI
job, where the dependency graph is resolvable) closes that half — it promotes
cargo-deny's `advisory-not-detected` diagnostic to an error, so an exception that
has outlived its finding fails the build instead of ageing into a false claim.

To change a statement: edit `rust-advisories.toml` (and `deny.toml` if the id
set changes), bump the document's `version` and `timestamp`, then run
`bash scripts/security/vex-generate.sh`.

### Why lock-file-only findings are in there

The last section of `rust-advisories.toml` carries advisories `cargo-deny`
never raises — because it resolves cargo FEATURES — but which a scanner reading
`Cargo.lock` alone does report. Those are precisely the findings that reach a
downstream consumer with no explanation attached anywhere in this repository,
which is the reason a published VEX document is worth more here than a comment.
They are deliberately absent from `deny.toml`'s ignore list: an ignore for an
advisory the gate never raises records nothing and would start applying
silently if the tool ever became lock-file-based. The generator enforces that
too.
