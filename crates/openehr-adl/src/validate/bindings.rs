//! Terminology-binding topic: the local binding KEYS (VTTBK / VTCBK) and the
//! external terminology-service seam that answers VETDF.
//!
//! Key validity is
//! `docs/specs/openehr/AM/docs/AOM2/master07-terminology_package.adoc`
//! §Validity Rules (a binding key is a defined at/ac-code, or a path that
//! resolves in the archetype). External term validity is
//! `master03-archetype_package.adoc` §Validity Rules, VETDF: "external term
//! validity. Each external term used within the archetype definition must exist
//! in the relevant terminology (subject to tool accessibility; codes for
//! inaccessible terminologies should be flagged with a warning indicating that
//! no verification was possible)."
//!
//! `openehr-adl` is a network-free spec engine (no app/SQL/REST — see the crate
//! `CLAUDE.md`), so it cannot hold a live terminology-service client. VETDF is
//! threaded through the [`TerminologyResolver`] seam, exactly like the
//! [`RmModel`](super::rm::RmModel) reference-model seam: the application injects
//! a resolver backed by its terminology service (the in-process `openehr-term`
//! bundle + any configured external FHIR TS), and the full-validation entry
//! points ([`super::validate`] / [`super::validate_source`]) consult it. Every
//! entry point that takes no resolver behaves as if a [`NoTerminologyResolver`]
//! were supplied (VETDF is silently not raised — no verification was possible),
//! matching the spec's "subject to tool accessibility" carve-out.
//!
//! The `_type` of a binding target and the terminology-id → resolver mapping are
//! deliberately kept out of this crate: the resolver receives the binding
//! target reference exactly as authored and owns all terminology-specific
//! interpretation.
