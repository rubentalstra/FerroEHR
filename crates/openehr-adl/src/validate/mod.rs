//! The AOM2 validation engine: orchestration over a catalogue of topic modules.
//!
//! A validator walks an assembled `openehr_am::v2_4::aom2` [`Archetype`]
//! and produces typed [`ValidationIssue`]s, each carrying a
//! [`ValidationCode`] (one variant per AOM2 validity
//! code), a [`Severity`], a message, and — where derivable
//! — the archetype path the issue is anchored at.
//!
//! This module holds ONLY the orchestration: [`ValidationIssue`], the five
//! public entry points, and the three drivers (`run_integrity_checks`,
//! `run_parent_conformance`, `run_flat_form_checks`) that call the topic modules
//! in the order the spec's phase schedule prescribes — master08's "phase 1 /
//! phase 2 / phase 3" in the spec's guide vocabulary. Every rule lives in the
//! topic module that owns its subject matter:
//!
//! | module | topic |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`catalogue`] | the code vocabulary: `Severity` + `ValidationCode` |
//! | `identification` | archetype id, root typename/concept, versions, languages, the terminology-structure gate |
//! | `structure` | the phase-1 definition-tree walk (node identity, cardinality, slots, assumed values) |
//! | `terminology` | term definitions, value sets and the codes the definition references |
//! | [`bindings`] | binding keys (VTTBK/VTCBK) + the external terminology-service seam (VETDF) |
//! | `annotations` | the `annotations` and `rm_overlay` sections |
//! | `source_level` | the checks that read the raw parsed source (VOKU, VRRLP) |
//! | `specialisation` | a differential child against its flat parent |
//! | [`slots`] | slot redefinition/filling + the template-filler pass |
//! | [`rm`] | the reference-model seam and its checks |
//! | [`conformance`] | the `master04.5` conformance functions the above build on |
//! | `flat` | everything decidable only on the flattened form |
//!
//! The phase-1 catalogue and its orchestration are defined in
//! `docs/specs/openehr/AM/docs/AOM2/master08-validation.adoc` §Phase 1 - Basic
//! Integrity, with the full rule texts in `master03-archetype_package.adoc`,
//! `master04.5-constraint_model-class_definitions.adoc`,
//! `master06-rm_overlay.adoc`, and `master07-terminology_package.adoc` (cited
//! per check in the topic modules); the phase-2 RM checks are `master08` §Phase
//! 2 → Validate Against Reference Model (cited per check in [`rm`]).
//!
//! Phase orchestration follows `master08` "multi-pass … more basic kinds of
//! errors being checked first": phase 2 runs only after phase 1 passes, which
//! [`validate`] / [`validate_source`] apply (`master08` §Overview). Those two
//! full-pipeline entries run the SAME phase set — a source-level entry may not
//! omit a phase, since AOM2 defines no partial-validation profile. Parent-
//! dependent checks (VACSD's depth comparison, VASID, VALC, VTPL) take an
//! optional [`ArchetypeRepository`]; when a parent is not supplied they degrade
//! to the standalone half they can compute (or are skipped).
//!
//! The specialised-archetype-vs-flat-parent checks (VSON*/VSANC*/VSSM/VDSS*/
//! VARX*/…) live in `specialisation` (with the slot arm in [`slots`]) and run
//! against the flat parent resolved via [`resolve_flat_parent`]; the
//! `master04.5` conformance functions they build on are in [`conformance`]. Per
//! `ADL2/master09.02` §Differential and Flat Forms ("For a top-level archetype,
//! the flat-form is the same as its differential form") a level-0 parent is used
//! as-is; a parent that is itself specialised needs the full flattener before
//! its DEEP flat form is available — which [`crate::flatten::flat_form`] now
//! supplies, so a specialised parent ([`FlatParent::NeedsFlattener`]) is
//! flattened before the deep phase-2 checks run. Phase 3 (`flat`) runs on the
//! flattened form (VUNP, VACMCO), per `master08` §Phase 3 - Validation of Flat
//! Form.
