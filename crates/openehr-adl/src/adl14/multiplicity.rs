//! Occurrences / cardinality reconciliation for the 1.4→2 conversion.
//!
//! Two rewrites, applied in this order by [`crate::adl14::convert`]: the 1.4
//! default `occurrences` is MATERIALISED (ADL 2 would infer a different one),
//! then RM-default multiplicity is ELIDED. Order matters — the materialisation
//! reads the 1.4 cardinality, which the elision may drop.
//!
//! NOTE: no openEHR spec governs 1.4→2 conversion — the whole `adl14` module is
//! our own design (see the [`crate::adl14`] flag); the two default rules
//! reconciled here are the spec-cited ones named below.

/// Materialise the ADL 1.4 default `occurrences` on container children before the
/// definition is emitted as ADL 2.
///
/// The two formalisms give an ABSENT `occurrences` different meanings, so the
/// default cannot be carried across implicitly:
///
/// - ADL 1.4 — `ADL1.4/master05-cadl.adoc` §Occurrences L316: "The default
///   occurrences, if none is mentioned, is `{1..1}`".
/// - ADL 2 — `AOM2/master04.5-constraint_model-class_definitions.adoc`
///   §Occurrences inferencing rules: an absent `occurrences` is inferred from the
///   owning attribute's cardinality upper (lower forced to 0), i.e.
///   `0..cardinality.upper`.
///
/// So an unstated 1.4 occurrences on a container child means "exactly once", and
/// leaving it unstated in the ADL 2 output would silently widen it to "none to
/// many". It is written out explicitly here.
///
/// Restricted to CONTAINER attributes because master05 L308 restricts the rule's
/// significance to them ("It only has significance for objects which are children
/// of a container attribute, since by definition, the occurrences of an object
/// which is the value of a single valued attribute can only be `0..1` or `1..1`,
/// and this is already defined by the attribute `existence`"). A `use_node`
/// internal reference is exempt: master05 L515 gives it the REFERENCED node's
/// occurrences, which is exactly what leaving it unstated means in ADL 2 once the
/// proxy is expanded.
