//! Phase-3 reachability through the source-level entry point.
//!
//! `openehr_adl::validate::validate_source` runs the SAME phase schedule as
//! `validate`. This module pins the half that a source-level entry used to skip:
//! the flat-form checks of
//! `docs/specs/openehr/AM/docs/AOM2/master08-validation.adoc` §Phase 3 -
//! Validation of Flat Form — "ensure `C_COMPLEX_OBJECT_PROXY` paths actually
//! exist in current flat form (VUNP)" and "ensure object node `occurrences`
//! valid with respect to enclosing `cardinality` (VACMCO)".
//!
//! Both are exercised on TOP-LEVEL archetypes, which is exactly the case a
//! phase-3-omitting entry could not reach: `ADL2/master09.02-spec_concepts.adoc`
//! §Differential and Flat Forms — "For a top-level archetype, the flat-form is
//! the same as its differential form" — so the flat form always exists and the
//! phase is always evaluable.
