//! Breadth gate over the vendored real-world archetype packs — both dialects.
//!
//! Two packs, two sources, because the two dialects are published in
//! different places (`.claude/rules/vendored-corpora.md`):
//!
//! - `corpus/archetypes/ckm/adl14/` — every
//!   archetype the public openEHR CKM publishes, as **ADL 1.4**
//!   (`scripts/vendor/ckm-archetypes.sh`). CKM publishes no ADL 2 export.
//! - `corpus/archetypes/adl2/ckm-2013-12-09/` —
//!   upstream's own CKM export carrying `*.adls` (**ADL 2**) beside `*.adl`
//!   (ADL 1.4) twins of the same archetypes, pinned by commit
//!   (`scripts/vendor/adl2-archetypes.sh`).
//!
//! The claim here is deliberately narrow and total: every file in both packs
//! PARSES in its own dialect. That is the breadth net the hand-written
//! `adl14-cadl`/`adl14-dadl` trees cannot provide — real clinical archetypes
//! carry constraint spellings, translation blocks and terminology sections no
//! authored fixture reproduces. Deeper claims (phase-1 validation, flattening)
//! stay with the rule-code-keyed `adl2-reference` corpus, whose file names
//! encode the expected outcome.
//!
//! NOTE: no openEHR spec governs 1.4 tolerance — our own design
//! ([`openehr_adl::adl14`]). Outcomes here are pinned by the packs themselves.
//!
//! Corpus discipline: 100% exercised, adjudicated refusals only. A file our
//! reader rejects is listed in the pack's `ADJUDICATED` table with the reason;
//! it stays vendored so the refusal is pinned, and a reader that starts
//! accepting it fails this gate.
