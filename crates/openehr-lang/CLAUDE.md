# `openehr-lang` — BMM / P_BMM / ODIN (hand-written tooling layer)

The LANG component: the BMM object model + the `*.bmm.json` loader that
**feeds codegen**, and the hand-written ODIN readers (`src/v1_1/odin/` +
`src/v1_0/odin/` — for ADL/ODIN *instance* parsing — deliberately off the
codegen path). Two component-version GENERATIONS: `v1_1` (the development
line, the prelude) and `v1_0` (the released LANG 1.0.0).

- **`src/v1_0/` is the Release-1.0.0 generation, and it carries ONLY what
  that release defines.** Generated: the 1.0.0 BMM model (`bmm/`,
  `bmm_persistence/`, `obsolete_elom/` — emitted faithfully from the
  released `openehr_lang_1.0.0.bmm.json`, defects verbatim). Hand-written:
  the ODIN reader (`odin/`), the ODIN-ONLY lexer (`lexer/` — `lex_odin` is
  the whole surface: 1.0.0 EL is DEVELOPMENT prose with no grammar, BEL
  first appears in 1.1.0, and the ADL reading's consumer pins v1_1), plus
  `escape.rs`/`position.rs`. Spec oracle: the Release-1.0.0 docs text
  (generation-identical to the vendored current text — every 1.0.0→current
  change is a typo fix, verified 2026-08-05) + the vendored 1.0.0 grammars
  `vendor/grammar/v1_0/{odin.g4, odin_values.g4, base_patterns.g4,
  base_lexer.g4}` (the release's own syntax-appendix include set). Every
  divergence from the v1_1 reader carries a `NOTE` with its 1.0.0 citation:
  lowercase-only attribute keys (`attribute_id : ALPHA_LC_ID`), the full
  `primitive_value` container-key set, the top-level `keyed_object+` /
  `included_other_language` document forms, `,`-only fractional seconds on
  times, `.`-only on durations, no `ALPHA_UNDERSCORE_ID`, lowercase-only
  path heads. Never "sync" the two generations — a 1.0.0 behaviour changes
  only on a re-derivation against the release text.

- **`src/nesting.rs` is the ONE nesting bound for the whole language stack**
  (`MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` = 512, the `Nesting` counter, `check_bracket_nesting`):
  the ODIN readers of BOTH generations pre-scan their token stream against it
  (a combinator parser has no per-level seam), the BEL parser threads it
  through its self-recursive productions, and `openehr-adl` imports the same
  constant for its cADL parser, flattener and OPT transform. Crossing it is a
  typed refusal (`OdinErrorKind::NestingTooDeep`, `BelError::NestingTooDeep`),
  never an abort. A walk reaches the bound before refusing, so a caller
  provides a stack sized for it (the CDR: a 256 MiB engine thread); tests
  that walk to the bound spawn such a thread. No openEHR spec bounds nesting.
- **This crate is upstream of everything generated.** A change to the BMM
  loader can silently change what `openehr-codegen` emits across five
  crates — after ANY loader/model change, run `/regen-codegen` and inspect
  the diff; the `codegen-drift` CI job is the backstop.
- **TWO BMM GENERATIONS, emitted side by side — never merge them.** openEHR
  publishes the stable **v2.x** BMM (`LANG/docs/bmm/`, which
  `master01-preface.adoc` §History calls "the normative, tool-implemented
  version", plus its `master06-persistence.adoc` P_BMM form) and the **v3**
  development line (`LANG/docs/bmm3/`, which adds the expression/statement
  meta-model); SPECLANG-14 formalised the split
  (`LANG/docs/bmm3/master00-amendment_record.adoc`). Both are vendored as
  separate `*.bmm.json` files and BOTH are emitted COMPLETELY:
  - the BMM v2.x unit → `src/v1_1/bmm/core/`, `src/v1_1/bmm/rm_access/`,
    `src/v1_1/bmm_persistence/`, `src/v1_1/beom/`;
  - the BMM3 unit → `src/v1_1/bmm3/**`.
  Both are SPECIFICATION UNITS of the ONE `v1_1` component-version
  generation (the published LANG index lists BMM — STABLE — and BMM3 —
  PAUSED — as sibling specifications of one version).
  18 class names occur in both files with materially different shapes
  (`BMM_CLASS`, `BMM_TYPE`, `BMM_PROPERTY`, `BMM_MODEL`, …), so each name
  yields TWO Rust types at two paths, each with its own intra-generation
  cross-references. The crate **prelude re-exports the generation's STABLE units only** (the
  BMM v2.x unit — `bmm`/`bmm_persistence`/`beom`); the PAUSED BMM3 unit
  (hold record #1920) is reachable by its full `v1_1::bmm3::` paths only.
  Never "unify" the two, never reach across generations in a type position,
  and never add a shadow/adapter type: a shape gap is a
  `tools/openehr-codegen` fix + regeneration.
- **BOTH generations now carry a hand-written spec-function surface, and they
  never share code.** the BMM v2.x unit: `src/v1_1/bmm/core/*_impl.rs` (`BMM_CLASSIFIER`,
  `BMM_CLASS`, `BMM_TYPE`, `BMM_PROPERTY`, `BMM_MODEL`, `BMM_PACKAGE`,
  `BMM_GENERIC_PARAMETER`, `BMM_OPEN_TYPE`) — the generation `rm_access`
  publishes. v3: `src/v1_1/bmm3/core/entity/bmm_type_impl.rs` (the type naming trio +
  flattening + the meta-type lattice: `is_abstract`/`is_primitive`/
  `type_base_name`/`unitary_type`/`effective_type`/`effective_base_class`/
  `is_open`/`is_closed`/`is_partially_closed`, plus the `From` impls that ARE the
  `BMM_TYPE ⊃ BMM_UNITARY_TYPE ⊃ BMM_EFFECTIVE_TYPE ⊃ BMM_MODEL_TYPE` lattice),
  `src/v1_1/bmm3/core/entity/bmm_class_impl.rs` (class attributes, `type()` generators,
  `generic_parameter_conformance_type`, `has_ancestor_class`, `all_ancestors`,
  `flat_features`, `BMM_ENUMERATION.name_map`),
  `src/v1_1/bmm3/core/feature/bmm_feature_impl.rs` (`signature()`/`arity()`/
  `is_boolean()`), `src/v1_1/bmm3/core/literal_value/bmm_literal_value_impl.rs`
  (`value_literal`/`syntax` + the literal-evaluation boundary), and
  `src/v1_1/bmm3/core/model/bmm_model_impl.rs` — the MODEL-level navigation the type
  lattice is the precondition for (`class_definition`, `all_ancestor_classes`,
  `property_definition` over the model-flattened property set, and
  `type_conforms_to` per `LANG/docs/bmm3/master06-core-types.adoc` §Type
  Conformance, whose Tuple and Signature branches are empty upstream and are
  therefore not realized). When a v2/v3
  boundary is recorded, name WHICH generation it belongs to — attributing a
  generation-specific gap to "the openEHR specs" is a misattribution the citation
  rule exists to prevent.
- **`src/v1_1/el/` is the hand-written Expression Language parser, and it is the ONLY
  writer of the `src/v1_1/bmm3/expression/` classes.** Spec oracle:
  `docs/specs/openehr/LANG/docs/EL/` plus the vendored normative grammars
  `vendor/grammar/v1_1/{ElLexer.g4, ElParser.g4}` (openEHR-antlr4), which the EL
  syntax appendix `masterAppA-syntax.adoc` includes verbatim. It follows the BEL
  house pattern — a recursive-descent parser generic over an `ElBuilder` — but
  shares NO productions with `src/v1_1/bel/`: `ElParser.g4` imports `Cadl2Parser`, not
  `base_expressions.g4`, renames every production, and its operator precedence
  comes from the EL tables (`master05-expressions.adoc` §Primitive Operators +
  §Precedence and Parentheses: `NOT` > `AND` > `OR` > `XOR` > `IMPLIES`), which
  CONTRADICT the BEL grammar's `or`/`xor` order. Two things to know:
  - **The vendored EL grammars are incomplete by themselves** — they
    `import Cadl2Lexer, SymbolsLexer, GeneralIdsLexer` / `Cadl2Parser`, none of
    which upstream publishes in that repository. The EL lexical reading is
    therefore the cADL layer for what `ElLexer.g4` does not declare and
    `ElLexer.g4`'s own case-SENSITIVE spelling for what it does; the
    `matches { … }` right-hand side is captured VERBATIM rather than parsed,
    because `cInlineOrderedObject`/`cObjectMatcher` are unvendored.
  - **Boundaries** (each refused with a typed `ElError::Unsupported`, never
    silently accepted): decision tables (`dlDecisionTable` and friends — their
    `BLOCK_DELIM` and `?` lexical forms have no union production), the
    quantifiers' mapping to a container function taking a Function agent, and
    the `matches` constraint leaf.
- **`src/v1_1/bmm3/statement/` stays inert, and `src/v1_1/bmm3/expression/` carries no
  spec BEHAVIOUR.** None of `eval_type()`, `reference()`, `is_callable()`,
  `operator_definition()`, `equivalent_call()` exists and none of the 9 declared
  invariants is enforced; do not add a `*_impl.rs` speculatively. The statement
  package is optional by the spec's own words
  (`LANG/docs/bmm3/master12-statements.adoc` §Overview: "This facility is not
  needed for achieving the original purpose of BMM"). The expression classes
  are now CONSTRUCTED (by `src/v1_1/bmm_persistence/create_bmm3_assertion.rs`), which
  is a different thing from evaluating them.
  `beom` is a DIFFERENT spec's object model (BEL, STABLE) and is never wired into
  `BMM_ASSERTION`; that would be a category error.
- **Two abstract, attribute-free v3 classes emit as instantiable empty structs** —
  `BMM_VISIBILITY` and `BMM_FEATURE_EXTENSION` (`bmm3/core/feature/`). Upstream
  declares them abstract with zero attributes and zero descendants, and marks the
  visibility meta-model unfinished (`LANG/docs/bmm3/master08-core-features.adoc`
  §Feature Groups and Visibility: "TBD: define visibility meta-model"), so the
  emitter has no better shape; the adjudication is recorded at the decision site
  (`tools/openehr-codegen/src/plan/mod.rs`, the abstract-with-no-descendants
  branch). Do not "fix" this in the crate — a declared subtype set upstream turns
  each into an untagged enum automatically.
- Codegen consumes the JSON BMM serialization only
  (`tools/openehr-codegen/vendor/bmm/`); the ODIN reader exists for
  ADL/ODIN instance text, not for loading meta-models.
- **`src/v1_1/lexer/` is the ONE lexer in the workspace** for the ADL/ODIN/BEL
  family — one `logos` token superset (`lexer::Token`/`Spanned`, the union of
  `base_lexer.g4` + `adl_keywords.g4` + `odin.g4`/`odin_values.g4` +
  `base_expressions.g4`) plus three thin entry points `lex_adl` / `lex_odin` /
  `lex_bel` that apply a per-language **reclassification pass** over the shared
  stream. Never add a second lexer, here or in a consuming crate; a language's
  lexical difference is a rule in `lexer/reclassify.rs`, never a new DFA.
  - Keyword variants stay UNIT variants: a language that does not reserve a
    word gets the identifier variant back, re-tagged from the source slice at
    the token's span. `LANG/docs/odin/master03-basics.adoc` §Keywords ("ODIN
    has no keywords of its own") is why the ODIN pass demotes every cADL/BEL
    keyword; `AM/docs/ADL2/master07.04` (section keywords "can safely appear
    as identifiers") is why section words are not tokens at all.
  - Where a language's longest match is SHORTER than the union's, the pass
    narrows by retrying shorter prefixes — the union always matches at least
    as far as any member, so no member ever needs a merge.
  - The Expression Language reading (`lex_el`) joined the union when the EL
    grammars were vendored. It reserves ONLY what `ElLexer.g4` itself declares
    — the cADL constraint keywords (`existence`, `occurrences`, `infinity`, …)
    are ordinary feature names in EL expression position, because they are
    reachable only inside a `matches { … }` block the EL parser captures
    verbatim. Two `ElLexer.g4` symbols have no union production and are not
    lexable: `?` (`SYM_INTERROGATION`, reached only by `dlBinaryChoice`) and
    the guillemets `«`/`»` (reached by no `ElParser.g4` production at all).
  - The three readings are pinned token-, span- and payload-for-payload by
    `tests/it/lexer_equivalence.rs` against fixtures captured from the three
    pre-unification lexers. **Editing a fixture line changes an accepted or
    refused lexical surface** and needs an adjudicated, spec-cited reason.
- **`src/v1_1/bmm_persistence/` is generated types + a hand-written P_BMM SCHEMA
  READER.** The `P_BMM_*` type files are generated; beside them live the
  hand-written pipeline `master02-overview.adoc` §Conceptual Approach
  prescribes — `reader.rs` (ODIN text → `P_BMM_SCHEMA`, a STRICT read: an
  attribute the class docs do not declare is a typed error, with two
  spec-cited tolerance lists), `include_resolution.rs` (transitive inclusion
  merge, includer wins, collisions marked `is_override`), `create_model.rs`
  (`P_BMM` → **v2.x** `BMM_MODEL`, all name references resolved to object
  references), `create_bmm3_model.rs` (`P_BMM` → **v3** `BMM_MODEL` — its own
  module precisely because the two generations give the same Rust NAMES to
  different types and import renaming is forbidden), `loader.rs` (the composed
  `load_model`), `error.rs` (the one typed `PBmmReadError`), `validate.rs` (the
  model validity checker), plus
  `p_bmm_*_impl.rs` spec functions, and `create_bmm3_assertion.rs` (persisted
  assertion STRING → `BMM_ASSERTION`, over the `src/v1_1/el/` parser).
  **Two failure layers, deliberately separate.** `PBmmReadError` is FAIL-FAST
  and every variant names a condition under which no `BMM_*` object can be
  constructed. `validate.rs` COLLECTS what construction survives: the
  `bmm3/master05-core-model.adoc` §Packages rules ("every class is contained
  within exactly one package"; "all classes in a BMM model should be uniquely
  named", matched case-insensitively per §Naming Convention) plus
  non-conformant property redefinition — that last one flagged in the finding's
  own docs as our own extension, because the released text leaves it open
  (`bmm3/master13-model_semantics.adoc` §Inheritance and Invariants,
  Pre-conditions and Post-conditions is `TBD`). There is deliberately NO
  sibling-package-prefix check: §Packages says package paths "are not used as
  namespaces as in UML", so no prohibition exists to enforce. Moving a check
  between the two layers changes what the pipeline REFUSES — adjudicate it,
  never drift it. The vendored corpus and the pinned component schemas are
  pinned finding-for-finding in `tests/it/vendor_bmm_schema.rs`: the released
  RM 1.2.0 and AM 1.4.0 schemas genuinely violate §Packages, so those rows are
  adjudicated, not clean. That module's third table covers ALL 18 vendored
  component ODIN generations — seven materialise, and **eleven are adjudicated
  refusals of released schemas that reference a class their own inclusion
  closure does not define** (TERM/RM-1.0.x/LANG-1.0.0 declare no `includes` at
  all against `master04-syntax.adoc` §Classes for Primitive Types;
  `BMM_ENUMERATION.item_values: List<T>` names a formal parameter its owner
  never declares; LANG v3's `EL_CASE.value_constraint: C_OBJECT` reaches into
  AM). Those are upstream defects, not reader gaps: never loosen a check to
  make one pass. Class-name
  resolution is case-insensitive (`master04-syntax.adoc` §Non-primitive
  Classes: `name` — "any capitalisation can be used"); embedding depth and
  every other cycle/boundary decision is adjudicated in the module docs, with
  the boundaries written out — and each one names the GENERATION it belongs to:
  `value_constraint`, P_BMM `functions`/`constants` and a generic ancestor's
  parameter binding have no destination in the **v2.x** `BMM_*` model
  `create_model.rs` materialises (P_BMM is the v2.x persistence form,
  `LANG/docs/bmm/master06-persistence.adoc`), while the **v3** classes DO declare
  all three (`org.openehr.lang.bmm3.bmm_class.adoc` §Attributes,
  `…bmm3.bmm_model_type.adoc` §Attributes) — and `create_bmm3_model.rs` lands
  them, together with the generic-substituted properties
  `LANG/docs/bmm3/master13-model_semantics.adoc` §Generic Inheritance requires
  (an ancestor's formal parameter replaced by the descendant's binding, stamped
  `is_synthesised_generic`; a declared property is never displaced, and the
  ancestor is rebuilt rather than read off its embedded stub, which is what
  propagates a substitution down a partially-closed chain). Class invariants and routine
  pre-/post-conditions land in the v3 generation only
  (`create_bmm3_assertion.rs`); a string that is not EL, or whose names do not
  resolve, is a COLLECTED `PBmmValidityFinding::AssertionNotMaterialised`
  (`create_bmm3_model_reporting` returns them), never a refusal — openEHR's own
  published schemas write most invariants in an Eiffel-flavoured surface syntax
  the normative EL grammar does not admit, and `tests/it/el_assertions.rs` pins
  every such refusal. Both transforms share one index +
  enumeration-validity check (`Builder`, `check_enumeration_validity`, module-
  private via `pub(super)`), so they can never disagree about what a class or a
  valid enumeration IS. A persisted `P_BMM_INTERFACE` IS a class-list
  member (`master02-overview.adoc` §Conceptual Approach + openEHR's own
  published BASE/RM schemas): the emitter re-opens the `P_BMM_CLASS` subtype set
  for it (`plan/overrides.rs` `SUBTYPE_EXTENSIONS`), the reader materialises its
  name/documentation/functions, and `create_model.rs` projects it as an abstract
  `BMM_CLASS`. This reader is NOT the codegen path either — codegen still
  consumes only the `.bmm.json` serialisation via `openehr-codegen`.
- **`src/v1_1/bmm/rm_access/` is the schema-REPOSITORY facade over that reader**
  (`LANG/docs/bmm/master04-rm_access.adoc`): `*_impl.rs` behaviour on the
  generated `REFERENCE_MODEL_ACCESS` / `SCHEMA_DESCRIPTOR` data classes plus a
  typed `error.rs`. It is the ONLY module in this crate that touches the
  filesystem (the spec puts `schema_directories` on the class), and it adds
  nothing to the pipeline semantics: directory scan → load-list closure →
  descriptor lifecycle (`load` → `validate` + `validate_includes` →
  `create_schema`) → `valid_models`. Zero-argument spec signatures that need the
  candidate set (`is_top_level`, `create_schema`) take it as a parameter, each
  with the adjudication at the site — never a synthetic `meta_data` key or a
  shadow field.
- **`src/v1_1/odin/` is the real ODIN reader** (a `chumsky` parser over
  `lexer::lex_odin` + an `OdinValue` tree; `openehr_lang::odin::parse`), NOT
  part of the generated/`bmm*`/`beom` model — never route it through codegen.
  Spec oracle: `docs/specs/openehr/LANG/docs/odin/` + the vendored grammars
  `vendor/grammar/v1_1/{odin.g4,odin_values.g4,base_lexer.g4}`. `openehr-adl`
  consumes it to parse ADL2 ODIN sections. Do not touch
  `bmm`/`bmm3`/`beom`/`bmm_persistence` when editing `odin`.
- **`src/v1_1/escape.rs` is the ONE home for `master03` string-escape semantics**
  (`LANG/docs/odin/master03-basics.adoc` §File Encoding + §Special Character
  Sequences, verbatim in `AM/docs/ADL2/master03-file_encoding.adoc`): the six
  quoted forms plus BOTH `\uHHHH` and `\uHHHHHHHH`, and NOTHING else — the set
  is closed ("Any other character combination starting with a backslash is
  illegal"), so an unknown sequence, an unpaired trailing backslash, a `\u`
  with the wrong digit count, and a `\u` that denotes no character are each a
  typed `EscapeError`, never pass-through text. The shared lexer's
  `STRING`/`CHARACTER` callbacks call `escape::validate` beside their
  structural escape scan (so a token never carries an undecodable escape,
  which is what lets the ODIN and BEL parsers decode infallibly), and
  `openehr-adl`'s cADL parser calls `escape::decode` and reports a defect at
  the literal's span. Never re-implement escape decoding anywhere.
- Spec authority: `docs/specs/openehr/LANG/docs/` (bmm, odin). Parser
  behaviour divergences are spec-citable, never silent.
- Spec pins are per generation: the emitted `Generation` enum is the ONLY
  pin authority (no version constants; both vendored v1_1 BMM files are
  1.1.0-line snapshots). The released 1.0.0 machine-readable BMM emits the
  `v1_0` generation FAITHFULLY, defects verbatim (#1946 reversed the #1942
  refusal; the defect class stays reported in upstream-report #1927).
- Gates: `cargo clippy -p openehr-lang --all-targets` +
  `cargo nextest run -p openehr-lang`, plus a drift check when the model
  changed.

- `src/json_serde.rs` is GENERATED by `emit-json` — the canonical-JSON
  `serde::Serialize`/`Deserialize` impls for this crate's types, over the shared
  hand-written runtime `openehr_base::serde_support`. Never hand-edit it; change
  `tools/openehr-codegen/src/render/emit_json.rs` and regenerate.
