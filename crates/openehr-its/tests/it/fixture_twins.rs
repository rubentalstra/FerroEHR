//! **Fixture twins** for the defective documents the strict canonical-JSON
//! reader refuses — the two in the vendored `openehr_sdk` corpus, plus the
//! repo-authored pair for the repeated-member refusal.
//!
//! Both were latent negatives: they only ever read because the canonical-JSON
//! reader was tolerant. Under the strict reader (an undeclared wire key is a
//! refusal; an identifier is built through the BASE grammar) each one is
//! refused — correctly. The owner's twins rule then applies: a spec-correct
//! refusal keeps BOTH halves, so this module pins
//!
//! * the **invalid twin** — the vendored file, kept byte-verbatim (a vendored
//!   corpus is never hand-edited; it is external ground truth), with an
//!   asserted refusal naming the path and the offending member, so a reader
//!   that silently loosened would fail here; and
//! * the **valid twin** — a repo-authored correction under
//!   `tests/fixtures/twins/`, which must read AND round-trip, so the defect is
//!   proven to be the fixture's rather than the model's.
//!
//! The vendored halves are listed in `common::excluded` (the corpus gates'
//! single documented exclusion list) so the exclusion is auditable rather than
//! silent.
