//! Regression gate: canonical RM shapes are BUILT from the generated
//! `openehr-*` types, never hand-written as `json!` literals.
//!
//! A `json!` literal carrying a `"_type"` key is, by definition, a hand-rolled
//! canonical openEHR fragment — the scanner mechanics live in
//! [`testkit::json_literals`] (shared by every crate's gate); this file owns
//! ONLY this crate's adjudications (issue #1686; extended to this crate by
//! #2444; the Simplified Formats sites moved to `openehr-sdt` with their
//! engine under #3482, so this crate's list is empty). To add a site, classify
//! it and put it in [`ALLOWLIST`] with a one-line reason — every entry must
//! name why that file's literals are NOT a synthesized canonical shape. A
//! stale entry (allowlisted file with no remaining literals) fails too, so the
//! list cannot rot.

/// Files whose `_type`-carrying `json!` literals are classified as something
/// other than a synthesized canonical shape, each with the reason.
const ALLOWLIST: &[(&str, &str)] = &[];

/// No production `json!` literal outside the classified allowlist synthesizes a
