//! Refusals the XML reader must keep making, each pinned as an asserted
//! negative test.
//!
//! Two properties here are held by a DEPENDENCY's current behaviour rather than
//! by this code, which is exactly the kind that changes silently: `quick-xml`
//! declares that it does not parse DTDs (<https://docs.rs/quick-xml/>), so no
//! entity declaration is ever recorded and an external entity cannot resolve.
//! Rather than rely on that, the reader refuses a DOCTYPE outright and refuses
//! any entity outside the five predefined names — and these tests assert the
//! refusals, so the guarantee stops depending on an upstream implementation
//! detail.
//!
//! The depth bound is different in kind: without it, the recursive descent in
//! the generated `FromXml` impls overflows the stack, and a Rust stack overflow
//! ABORTS the process instead of unwinding — so the catch-panic layer that
//! renders this server's clean `500` cannot intercept it, and one request would
//! take the process down for every caller.
//!
//! No openEHR spec governs these bounds — our own design.
