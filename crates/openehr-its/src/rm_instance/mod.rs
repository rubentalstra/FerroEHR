//! **RM-instance validation** — the template-independent passes over a
//! canonical-JSON RM tree, plus the report shape every validation surface of
//! this crate speaks.
//!
//! These checks are properties of the *instance value alone*: they hold for
//! every COMPOSITION, EHR_STATUS, FOLDER, or demographic PARTY tree whether or
//! not an operational template is referenced. Two collecting passes recurse the
//! whole instance:
//!
//! 1. **RM-invariant pass** — for every node with a
//!    `_type`, or whose parent attribute declares a concrete RM type
//!    ([`openehr_rm::v1_2::model::declared_concrete_type`]), run its core RM class
//!    invariants ([`crate::wire_validate::validate_rm_invariants_as`]) plus the
//!    JSON-level per-node checks of [`openehr_rm::v1_2::validate`]
//!    (mandatory-container lower bounds, the present-but-empty list family,
//!    `LOCATABLE.Archetyped_valid`, the data-structure shape duties). This pass
//!    is independent of any `WebTemplate`, so class invariants on nodes a
//!    template would fold away (ELEMENT / `ITEM_TREE` / HISTORY / EVENT) are
//!    still checked.
//! 2. **Terminology pass** ([`terminology`]) — validates the RM-mandated openEHR
//!    terminology-group and code-set codes (composition `category`, context
//!    `setting`, `null_flavour`, `ISM_TRANSITION` `current_state`,
//!    PARTICIPATION `function`/`mode`, …) against the shared binding table in
//!    [`openehr_rm::v1_2::validate::terminology`], backed by [`openehr_term::bundle`].
//!
//! Both key their violations by an RM **instance** path (`/content[0]/…`).
//!
//! The decisions themselves live in `openehr-rm` (pure RM value semantics);
//! this module owns only the *walk* — recursing the tree, carrying the
//! effective declared type down, and prefixing the absolute RM path onto each
//! node-relative [`openehr_base::validate::InvariantViolation`].
//!
//! The third, template-driven pass (archetype conformance against a flattened
//! `WebTemplate`) lives in [`crate::flat::validation`]; [`validate_composition`]
//! is the composed entry point that runs all three.
