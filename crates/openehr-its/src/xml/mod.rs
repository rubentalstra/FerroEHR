//! **ITS-XML** — canonical XML serialization (openEHR ITS-XML).
//!
//! A document is written in either of
//! the two published wire lineages: `http://schemas.openehr.org/v1`
//! (Release-1.0.2v2, the STABLE bundle) and `http://schemas.openehr.org/v2`
//! (Release-2.0.0v2, TRIAL upstream). One generated impl set serves both: the
//! documents it writes differ only by the root `xmlns`, selected at serialize
//! time. The two vendored SCHEMA bundles are not equivalent, though — the v1
//! bundle is frozen at an older RM generation (`schemas/xml/PROVENANCE.md`
//! §"Two lineages"), so a served v1 document can carry RM 1.2.0 members its
//! own schema predates.
//!
//! The `ToXml`/`FromXml` impls for the RM/BASE spec types are **generated** by
//! `openehr-codegen`'s `emit-xml` target into `generated`, driven by
//! the vendored XSDs (`schemas/xml/`) + the BMM field model. This module is the
//! hand-written [`runtime`] (traits + `quick-xml` writer/reader) and the public
//! entry points. Regenerate with `cargo run -p openehr-codegen -- emit-xml`.
