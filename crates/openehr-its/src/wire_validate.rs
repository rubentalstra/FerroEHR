//! The **wire-boundary RM class-invariant dispatcher** — the thin entry points
//! that compose the validation tiers at the codec boundary.
//!
//! The tiers themselves are RM model semantics and live upstream in
//! [`openehr_rm::v1_2::validate`]: the allocation-free fast path and the
//! authoritative typed dispatch. Three things stay here because they need this
//! crate:
//!
//! - the generated five-crate structural fallthrough ([`structural_check`]),
//!   which spans every spec crate at once and so can only be emitted
//!   downstream of all of them;
//! - the undeclared-key refusal, which reads [`declared_fields`] and renders
//!   the reader's own [`crate::json::JsonParseError`];
//! - the entry points, which fix the ORDER the tiers and the orthogonal layers
//!   run in.
//!
//! A node that does not deserialize into its declared concrete RM type surfaces
//! `does not conform to RM type …`.
