//! Enforcement-reach instrumentation:
//! every terminology slot in the RM binding table is PROVABLY reachable —
//! a violating instance is detected and its valid twin is clean — so a
//! never-exercised enforcement site is a failing test instead of a latent
//! gap (`EVENT_CONTEXT.setting` had zero wire exercise until the TERM
//! program added it, and the escape behind it survived precisely because
//! nothing measured reach).
//!
//! The slot inventory is DERIVED (`openehr_rm::v1_2::model::classes()` ×
//! `validate::terminology::slots_for`), never a second hand list; the total is
//! pinned so an arm for a type outside the static model cannot vanish
//! silently. The invariant-core dimension (the generated cores in
//! `openehr_rm::v1_2::validate::generated`) is deliberately OUT of constructive
//! scope: cores are arbitrary predicates whose violating instances are not
//! mechanically derivable from the model — their reach is carried by the
//! fast-vs-typed corpus equivalence battery and the per-invariant unit tests
//! beside each `*_impl.rs`, and the boundary is recorded here rather than
//! silently skipped.
