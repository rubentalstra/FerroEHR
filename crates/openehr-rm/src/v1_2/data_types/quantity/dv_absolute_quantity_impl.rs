//! Hand-written `DV_ABSOLUTE_QUANTITY` spec behaviour, shared by its
//! descendants.
//!
//! `DV_ABSOLUTE_QUANTITY` is abstract, so the generated `DvAbsoluteQuantity` is
//! a subtype enum and the accuracy rule its `add`/`subtract`/`diff` declare has
//! no single struct to live on. It is realized once here and called by
//! `DV_DATE`, `DV_TIME` and `DV_DATE_TIME`.
//!
//! The rule differs from `DV_AMOUNT`'s in what it operates on rather than in
//! what it says: accuracy here is redefined as a `DV_AMOUNT` — a `DV_DURATION`
//! for the three temporal descendants — so the "sum of the accuracies" is a
//! duration sum, not a real one.
