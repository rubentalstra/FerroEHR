//! RM-level validation glue (hand-written spec behaviour).
//!
//! Everything here judges a canonical-JSON RM node AS A VALUE — no codec, no
//! template, no wire context — and reports [`InvariantViolation`]s relative to
//! that node:
//!
//! 1. **The allocation-free fast-path RM class-invariant check**
//!    ([`try_fast_validate`] → the private `fast` path) over a live canonical-JSON node, plus
//!    the **shared invariant helpers** used by the sibling `*_impl.rs`
//!    behaviour files (the DV_AMOUNT / DV_QUANTIFIED accuracy + magnitude-status
//!    rules, the LOCATABLE `Archetype_node_id_valid` rule, ISO-8601 value
//!    checks).
//! 2. **The JSON-level per-node checks the typed model cannot express** —
//!    [`check_mandatory_containers`] (model-driven container lower bounds),
//!    [`check_archetyped_valid`] and [`check_data_structure_shapes`]. Each is
//!    a pure function over the node's own value, run as its own layer beside
//!    the fast/typed core pair so the equivalence property between those two
//!    stays exactly the core property. (The `x /= Void implies not x.is_empty`
//!    family holds BY CONSTRUCTION — `Option<NonEmptyVec<T>>`/`NonEmptyVec<T>`
//!    shapes make the forbidden state unrepresentable.)
//! 3. **The terminology-backed invariants**, in the sibling [`terminology`]
//!    module (they need the openEHR terminology bundle, not just the node).
//! 4. **The `553|incomplete|` presence relaxation predicates**, in the sibling
//!    [`incomplete`] module: the pair of pure model-driven questions ("is
//!    anything missing?" / "is anything wrong?") that RM common
//!    `master06-change_control_package.adoc` §Incomplete Content splits a
//!    node's structural judgement into. Used only by the relaxed
//!    (`553|incomplete|`) commit path; the strict path never calls them.
//! 5. **The typed-dispatch tier**, in the sibling [`typed_dispatch`] module:
//!    the `_type` → concrete-RM-type table that *deserializes* a node through
//!    the emitted canonical-JSON `serde` impls (`crate::json_serde`) and runs
//!    that class's `Validate` impl — the authoritative oracle the fast path may
//!    only skip when its result is provably identical.
//!
//! Kept out of this crate, in `openehr-its`: the generated five-crate structural
//! dispatch [`typed_dispatch::dispatch_typed`] falls through to (it spans every
//! spec crate at once), the wire-boundary entry points that compose the tiers,
//! and the walkers that prefix absolute RM paths.
//!
//! # The invariant source and the diagnostic form
//!
//! The invariants realized here are the released class tables' own expressions,
//! machine-classified from the vendored BMM; the generated register in
//! `validate/generated.rs` is the per-invariant authority. A failure renders
//! `Invariant <Name> failed on type <RM_TYPE>`, where `<Name>` is the released
//! class-table name (`docs/specs/openehr/RM/docs/UML/classes/*.adoc`
//! §Invariants). No openEHR spec governs the message wording — `invariant_failed`
//! is its single home.
//!
//! Three things deliberately do NOT run in the core/typed tiers:
//!
//! - terminology-bound invariants, which resolve a code against the openEHR
//!   terminology bundle rather than inspecting the node, so they run as a
//!   post-core layer in the sibling [`terminology`] module — never inside the
//!   fast/typed pair, whose equivalence property covers the core invariants
//!   only;
//! - invariants adjudicated out of the per-node layer, each carrying a
//!   citation-pinned `Excluded` adjudication in the generated register;
//! - cross-child recursion: each `Validate` impl checks its own class
//!   invariants, and the composition validator recurses.
