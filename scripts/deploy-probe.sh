# The deployment-conformance harness (#2178).
#
# The conformance instrument exists because "we believe the REST surface is
# conformant" was not good enough — it had to be MEASURED, repeatably, by
# something that outlives the person who ran it. This is the same instrument for the other
# half: "we believe the deployment works".
#
# The gap it covers is real and was expensive. A 4447-test suite was green
# while ten defects shipped, every one of them living between "the code is
# correct" and "the thing we hand an operator works" — a gateway with no
# bucket, an OIDC realm that could not mint an acceptable token, a Prometheus
# that scraped nothing, host environment silently dropped on the floor. None of
# them was reachable by rendering YAML or by a unit test with a mock.
#
# Three rules it holds itself to, each one a lesson from those defects:
#
#   1. Observe at the FAR END. Not "the API said 201" but "the blob is in the
#      bucket"; not "the config looks right" but "the server reports it".
#   2. Follow the DOCUMENTATION, not the source. Several findings were the book
#      describing something that does not work, and a probe configured the way
#      the source says would never catch that class again.
#   3. Say what was NOT exercised. Silence read as coverage is how this
#      happened; the report ends with the gaps, in its own output.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/deploy-probe.sh                  # the compose platform
#   scripts/deploy-probe.sh --keep-up        # leave the stack running to poke at
#
# Env:
#   FERROEHR_IMAGE   the server image under probe (default: the compose pin).
#                    The harness measures the SUT it is given — pointing it at
#                    an older image is a legitimate way to watch a regression
#                    probe fail.
#   PROBE_OUT        where the machine-readable record lands.
