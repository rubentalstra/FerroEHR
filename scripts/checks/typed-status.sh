# Typed-status guard (owner directive 2026-08-06).
#
# An HTTP status is compared as a TYPE, never as a number:
#
#     if status == StatusCode::OK { … }          // yes
#     if status.as_u16() == 200 { … }            // no
#     if status == 200 { … }                     // no
#
# `http::StatusCode` exists so the compiler catches a typo'd or misremembered
# code; `as_u16() == 401` throws that away, and a bare literal tells a reader
# nothing about which of the 4xx family was meant. The `http` crate names every
# registered code (docs.rs/http/latest/http/status/struct.StatusCode.html), so
# there is always a constant to use.
#
# Rendering the number is fine and stays legal — a log field, a metric label, a
# recorded wire outcome (`status.as_u16()` inside `format!`, a struct field, a
# `/ 100` class bucket). Only COMPARISON against a numeric literal is refused.
#
# The three shapes below are all the same violation, and the guard has to see all
# three or it reports OK on a tree containing the pattern it exists to ban (which
# it did, on two live sites, until this was widened):
#
#     if status.as_u16() == 401 { … }                    // direct
#     let status = resp.status().as_u16(); if status == 401 { … }   // via a local
#     assert_eq!(resp.status(), 200);                    // via an assertion
#
# The second is caught by matching the COMPARISON of a status-named binding
# against a literal, wherever it sits — not by flagging the `as_u16()` binding
# itself, and not by flagging a `status: u16` parameter. Those two broader rules
# were tried and rejected on merit: they fire on code that legitimately RECEIVES a
# recorded wire number, which is the conformance runner's whole job (its catalogue
# stores expected statuses as JSON numbers and compares recorded against expected
# — a data-driven comparison with no literal in it, and correct as it stands).
# What the rule forbids is a LITERAL in the comparison, so that is what the guard
# looks for, in every form it can take: direct, through a local, in a `matches!`,
# and in an assertion.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/typed-status.sh [--all | <file>...]
#   no args  → the files changed against origin/develop
#   --all    → every tracked .rs file

cd "$(dirname "$0")/../.."

# `--all` covers the WHOLE tree. Both parked sweeps have landed: the runner
# (#2054) holds `StatusCode` in memory and applies `.as_u16()` only where a
# number is rendered or serialized, and the console (#2055) compares through
# `CdrResponse::is(StatusCode)` and named constants, its `status: u16` DTO
# fields staying numeric because they are deserialized from and rendered into
# wire JSON. `--all-really` is kept as an alias so callers written against
# the parked-era flag keep working.
