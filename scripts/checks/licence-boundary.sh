# The Apache-2.0 crates never depend on a BUSL-1.1 crate.
#
# Six `crates/*` packages publish under Apache-2.0 (the five generated model
# crates and the `openehr-its` wire layer) so any Rust project can take them;
# three hand-written engines publish under BUSL-1.1. A normal or build
# dependency from the first set on the second would make every consumer of the
# Apache wire layer compile BUSL code, which the licence split exists to rule
# out. Dev-dependencies are exempt: cargo strips them at packaging, so one
# never reaches a consumer.
#
# Four assertions over every `crates/*/Cargo.toml`, all mechanical:
#   1. the package is classified on exactly one side of the boundary, so a new
#      crate cannot publish without being placed;
#   2. its `license` matches its side: an Apache crate names `Apache-2.0` and
#      never `BUSL-1.1`, a BUSL crate is exactly `BUSL-1.1`, so relicensing a
#      crate cannot move it across silently;
#   3. an Apache crate's `[dependencies]` and `[build-dependencies]`, including
#      the `[target.*]` forms and a dependency renamed with `package =`, name no
#      BUSL crate;
#   4. no feature of an Apache crate names a BUSL crate (`dep:x`, `x/feature`,
#      `x?/feature`, or the bare optional-dependency name).
#
# No openEHR spec governs any of this — our own design.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/licence-boundary.sh [--self-test]
#   no args     → every manifest under crates/
#   --self-test → prove each refusal on a mutated copy of the manifests
