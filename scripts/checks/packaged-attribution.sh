# A crate that PACKAGES third-party bytes carries that material's attribution
# INSIDE the package, pinned to the revision the repository records.
#
# The per-tree `PROVENANCE.md` is the repository's record and does not travel:
# it describes the whole vendored tree, and for `openehr-its` that tree is 784
# schema files while the published package ships exactly one of them. So the
# packaged attribution is a SECOND statement of the same pin — which is
# precisely the shape that drifts, because a re-vendor updates the provenance
# record and can leave the packaged text quoting a revision nobody vendors any
# more. This gate makes that a failing build instead.
#
# Two mechanical assertions per row; neither judges prose:
#   1. the upstream revision recorded in the provenance file appears verbatim
#      in the packaged attribution file;
#   2. that attribution file is itself in the crate's `include` list, so it
#      actually reaches a consumer.
