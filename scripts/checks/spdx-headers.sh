# Every first-party Rust source file states its licensing INSIDE itself.
#
# `REUSE.toml` already covers the whole tree by glob and `reuse lint` proves it
# complete, but a glob declaration is exactly the thing that does NOT travel
# with a file. REUSE 3.3 exists for that property — licensing "is preserved when
# the file is copied and reused by third parties" — and only a header in the
# file delivers it. This gate is what keeps the headers from rotting away one
# new file at a time; `reuse lint` cannot see the difference, because the glob
# covers a headerless file just as well.
#
# SCOPE: tracked `.rs` files. Vendored trees are excluded, not exempted — a
# header there would assert something about somebody else's file, and
# hand-editing vendored material is forbidden. Other first-party file types
# (shell, SQL, YAML) are outside this gate.
#
# THE EXPECTED HEADER is derived from `REUSE.toml`, so the two can never
# disagree: every published spec crate is Apache-2.0 (the licence of the openEHR
# inputs it is generated from; the six that embed specification text also name
# the openEHR Foundation as a holder), and everything else is BUSL-1.1. A
# generation-twin template under `tools/openehr-codegen/templates/<crate>/`
# follows the crate it is stamped INTO, because its content is that crate's
# content.
#
# GENERATED FILES get their header from the emitter (`openehr-codegen`), never
# from a hand edit or from `--fix` here: a hand edit is silently overwritten by
# the next `emit` and fails `codegen-drift`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/checks/spdx-headers.sh          # verify (exit 1 on any violation)
#   scripts/checks/spdx-headers.sh --fix    # insert missing headers (hand-written only)

# The expected tags below are DATA this gate compares against, not this file's
