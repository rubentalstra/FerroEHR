# Privacy-boundary guard: a change that moves the pseudonymisation boundary is
# reviewed as such, and no real personal data enters the tree.
#
# Two gates, both over the diff:
#
#   1. A diff touching a privacy-boundary path needs the pull request template's
#      'Privacy boundary' checklist present and fully ticked. The checklist is
#      the record that the data flow, the roles, the grants and the access
#      events were thought about; this gate is what makes it binding.
#   2. The ADDED lines of the diff carry no value that looks like a real Dutch
#      identifier: a nine-digit number passing the BSN eleven-test (elfproef),
#      or a postcode followed by a house number. Tests and fixtures use
#      synthetic data (CONTRIBUTING.md § Personal data).
#
# GDPR Art. 25 makes the boundary a design-time duty
# (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj); no openEHR spec governs any
# of this - our own design.
#
# THE PATH LIST IS A SET OF PATTERNS MATCHED AGAINST THE DIFF, NEVER AN
# ASSERTION THAT THE PATHS EXIST. The demographic and linkage schemas, the
# linkage service, the identifier scanner and the access-event model are being
# built (issues #3153, #3158, #3154, #3156). The guard has to pass cleanly on a
# tree where those paths are absent and fire the moment the first of them
# appears, so it matches names rather than checking a directory listing.
#
# The eleven-test is arithmetic, not a lookup: a nine-digit number d1..d9 is a
# candidate BSN when 9*d1 + 8*d2 + 7*d3 + 6*d4 + 5*d5 + 4*d6 + 3*d7 + 2*d8 - d9
# is divisible by 11. Roughly one nine-digit number in eleven passes by chance,
# so the run has to be delimited by non-alphanumeric characters - without that,
# every hex digest and base64 blob in the tree produces hits at that rate.
#
# One structural carve-out, measured rather than guessed: a survey over every
# tracked file produced 22 hits and all 22 were SNOMED CT identifiers in AQL
# tests and OPT fixtures. An SCTID ends in a two-digit partition identifier plus
# a check digit, and every concept, description and relationship partition is
# `00`, `01`, `02`, `10`, `11` or `12`
# (https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT), so a nine-digit run
# with that shape ON A LINE ALSO MENTIONING snomed, sct or code is read as a
# terminology code. Both halves are required: the shape alone would blind the
# guard to 6% of the BSN space, and the words alone would blind it to any BSN
# beside the word "code".
#
# A deliberately synthetic value that still passes carries `privacy-allow:` and
# a reason on the same line, the shape ShellCheck directives use here. The
# marker exempts that line and nothing else.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/checks/privacy-boundary.sh                 # diff against origin/main
#   scripts/checks/privacy-boundary.sh --diff <base> [head]
#   CHANGED_FILES="a b c" scripts/checks/privacy-boundary.sh
#   scripts/checks/privacy-boundary.sh --self-test     # prove the detectors
#
# PR_BODY carries the pull request description. Unset means the checklist gate
# cannot be judged (a local run) and is reported as skipped; set-but-empty is a
# pull request with no body and fails.
