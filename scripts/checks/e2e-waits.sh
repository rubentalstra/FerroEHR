# E2E journey wait discipline (.claude/rules/leptos-ui.md §10).
#
# A browser journey drives a remote process over HTTP, and two shapes make a
# journey lie about what it observed:
#
#   1. A RAW `WebElement` (or a `SelectElement` built from one). Its commands
#      carry thirtyfour's own 120 s per-request default, which outlasts every
#      poll loop in the suite — so a driver that stops answering reads as a
#      button that was inert, and the journey skips the save and goes green on
#      the prior state. `tests/it/common/mod.rs` hands out `common::Element`
#      instead: it bounds every command and reads a failure to answer as a
#      failure.
#   2. A `sleep`. A timed wait is either too short on a loaded machine (a
#      flake) or wasted time on a quiet one, and it asserts nothing. Journeys
#      wait on conditions — the harness's `wait_*` and `poll_*` helpers.
#
# Scope is the journey files, `app/ferroehr-viewer/tests/it/e2e_*.rs`, and
# NOT `tests/it/common/mod.rs`: the harness is where the raw handle is wrapped
# and where the poll loops that do the sleeping live, so banning the vocabulary
# there would ban its own implementation. The harness's one deliberate timed
# wait is `common::dwell`, which exists because a journey asserting that a
# window passes WITHOUT something happening has no observable to poll for.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/e2e-waits.sh [--self-test]
#   no args     → every journey file
#   --self-test → prove the detector in both directions
