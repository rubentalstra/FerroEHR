# scripts/checks/tracker-status.sh — a book page never says "planned" about a
# closed issue, and never "shipped" about an open one (#3289).
#
# The control matrix is generated and cannot go stale; the prose around it can,
# and after the v4.2.0 cut the compliance overview still said "guidance planned,
# #3161" about pages that release had published. This guard reads every
# `#NNNN` issue reference on the book's pages (and every `issues: [...]` entry
# of the EHDS status source), fetches the issues' states in one call, and fails
# when a status word beside the reference contradicts the tracker.
#
# What counts as a contradiction, per LINE (a table row or a sentence):
#   - a PLANNED word (planned, not yet, upcoming, in progress, partly shipped,
#     partial, remains open, is tracked, not built) beside a reference to a CLOSED issue,
#     unless the line also says it shipped/landed/closed (a history sentence);
#   - a SHIPPED word (shipped, landed, closed in) beside a reference to an OPEN
#     issue, unless the line also carries a planned word (a split row).
#   - in website/book/ehds.yaml: `status: planned` whose `issues:` are all closed.
# Generated pages (control-matrix, ehds-readiness, technical-documentation) are
# render output of their own generators and are skipped.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/tracker-status.sh   (no arguments)
