# Every openEHR spec file a comment cites must exist under docs/specs/openehr/.
#
# The vendored spec text is the oracle (.claude/rules/spec-adherence.md), and a
# citation is how a reader checks that a behaviour is grounded. A citation that
# names no real file cannot be checked by anyone, so it is worth exactly as much
# as no citation at all — and it reads as authority while providing none. The
# 2026-08-11 template audit found eighteen of them, including a `master04-` that
# should have been `master06-` and two class paths carrying a sub-package
# segment the filenames do not have.
#
# What this does NOT check: whether a citation's SECTION exists, and whether
# quoted text is real. Both are review-enforced. The audit that motivated this
# also found a quotation ("include, but are not limited to") that appears
# nowhere in the vendored specs while naming a file that does exist — this guard
# would not have caught it, and pretending otherwise would be its own defect.
#
# Usage: spec-citations.sh [--all | <file>...]
