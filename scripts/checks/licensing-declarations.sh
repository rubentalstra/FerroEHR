# The licensing declarations, the licence texts and the licensing chapter must
# describe the same set of licences.
#
# `reuse lint` already proves that every file in the tree carries licensing
# information and that no licence text is orphaned. What it cannot check is the
# thing this repository actually gets wrong over time: the human-readable
# licensing chapter drifting away from the machine-readable declarations, so a
# compliance reviewer reading the site and a scanner reading `REUSE.toml` are
# told different things.
#
# Three assertions, all mechanical:
#   1. every SPDX identifier used in REUSE.toml has its text in LICENSES/;
#   2. every text in LICENSES/ is used by REUSE.toml (no orphan);
#   3. every SPDX identifier used in REUSE.toml is named in the licensing
#      chapter, so a licence cannot enter the tree without the page that
#      explains the tree acquiring it;
#   4. no first-party file still claims the licence the project LEFT. The
#      2026-09-03 move from MIT to the Business Source License 1.1 touched
#      headers, manifests, badges, image labels and pages at once; a claim that
#      survives that sweep, or comes back with a copied template, is a stale
#      statement about the project's own code. Third-party files keep their
#      own licences and are excluded, not exempted.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT check: whether the chapter's PROSE about a
# licence is correct. No tool can judge that, and a check that pretended to
# would be the kind of unenforced rule `.claude/rules/reliability.md` refuses.
