# Docs-claim guard: a documented KEY must exist in the thing it documents.
#
# The v3.17.4 book sweep found five substantive defects that had shipped to the
# published site — a fabricated Helm values table, a page asserting endpoints did
# not exist when six did, a `SPEC_VERSION` constant taught for crates that have
# none. None was caught by a gate: `mdbook-lint` checks style, `lychee` checks
# link reachability, and both pass happily on a page whose every technical claim
# is false. The same-PR docs rule depended entirely on an author noticing.
#
# This guard checks the claims that have a machine-readable authority to check
# against, and nothing else. Three of them:
#
#   1. Every `FERROEHR__…` environment form a page shows resolves to a real key
#      in `app/ferroehr/assets/ferroehr.default.toml`.
#   2. Every Helm values path a chart page shows resolves — against
#      `values.yaml`, or for the `config.*` subtree against the TOML schema,
#      because the chart renders `config:` VERBATIM to ferroehr.toml (so
#      `config.<any-toml-path>` is legitimate whether or not values.yaml
#      enumerates it, and the one non-TOML child, `config.files`, resolves in
#      values.yaml instead). The securityContext family and
#      `autoscaling.behavior` are passthroughs of the same kind — the chart
#      renders the whole Kubernetes type, so a documented child resolves on its
#      root and the API reference is the authority for the leaf.
#   3. Every committed generated chart under a `*-assets/` directory is embedded
#      by some page. An unreferenced chart is either a page that lost its figure
#      or a renderer emitting output nobody reads.
#
# What is NOT checked, and why — an unenforced rule is labelled as such
# (`.claude/rules/reliability.md`):
#
#   * **Documented Rust paths.** A grep-level existence check for
#     `crate::a::b` / `openehr_x::y::Z` was measured and rejected: prose names
#     types that exist under a different module path than the sentence implies,
#     and the generated crates' generation modules mean one type has several
#     valid paths. It produced more false positives than findings. Review-only.
#   * **Prose claims of any kind** — "six endpoints exist", "the chart renders
#     one key" — have no machine authority. Review-only, and the reason the
#     same-PR docs rule still matters.
#
# Scope note on check 2: the values vocabulary is only in scope on pages that
# document the chart. `configuration.md` legitimately writes
# `` `service.name` `` for the OpenTelemetry resource attribute, which collides
# with the chart's top-level `service:` key and is not a values path at all.
# Widening the check to every page turns that into a false failure, so the check
# reads the chart pages and the chart pages only.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/docs-claims.sh [--all | <file>...]
#   no args  → the book files changed against origin/develop
