# String-built-SQL guard for every layer that builds SQL at runtime.
#
# The AQL engine builds SQL dynamically from attacker-controlled query text, so
# the one property that keeps it safe is that the SQL SHAPE comes from our own
# code and every user-supplied value arrives as a bound parameter. The OWASP SQL
# Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet names the failure mode this guard blocks:
# "Validated data is not necessarily safe to insert into SQL queries via string
# building"
# (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).
#
# Four shapes fail, over the three directories that build SQL at runtime —
# `app/ferroehr/src/aql/`, `app/ferroehr/src/storage/` and
# `app/ferroehr/src/system_log/` (the ITI-81 audit retrieval, the other
# `sea-query` site):
#   1. `format!`/`write!`/`writeln!` whose literal holds a SQL keyword AND an
#      interpolation — an interpolated clause is string-built SQL by definition.
#   2. `push_str("…<SQL keyword>…")` — assembling a statement fragment by
#      fragment onto a String, the shape step 1 usually grows into.
#   3. `push_str(<runtime value>)` — a value appended to a string being built.
#      Whether that string is SQL cannot be decided by grep, so the rule is
#      strict and legitimate sites are exempted by name below.
#   4. `AssertSqlSafe(format!(…))` — the sqlx injection guard waived over an
#      interpolated string, which is the assertion being false.
#
# What this guard CANNOT see, so that nobody mistakes a green run for the whole
# property: an identifier passed to `sea_query::Alias::new` is indistinguishable
# from our own generated alias at the grep level. That half is pinned by tests
# instead — `app/ferroehr/tests/it/sql_injection.rs` asserts that every quoted
# identifier in the emitted SQL comes from the closed set, over a corpus of
# queries carrying hostile text in every user-supplied position.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/sql-string-building.sh [--all | --self-test | <file>...]
#   no args     → the changed files that fall inside the scanned directories
#   --all       → every tracked .rs file in those directories
#   --self-test → runs the guard over a fixture the guard flags, once with a
#   space-carrying exemption naming it and once with no exemption at all, and
#   asserts the first is accepted and the second rejected. The exemption list is
#   read line by line, and an iteration never shown to honour a needle with a
#   space is a green light nobody has tested (reliability.md §enforcement tiers).
