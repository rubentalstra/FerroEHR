# Every job in a gated workflow must be reachable from that workflow's sink.
#
# Branch protection points at ci.yml's `conclusion` alone, on purpose: that is
# what lets jobs be added, renamed or path-gated without editing repository
# settings. The cost of that design is that a job missing from the sink's
# `needs` still RUNS and still goes red, while merging stays green — a gate
# that looks enforced and is not. Not hypothetical: on 2026-08-12 four gates
# (`chart-boot`, `error-source-chain`, `no-python`, `spec-citations`) were
# found running without gating anything.
#
# release.yml has the same shape with `announce` as the sink (#2838): a leg
# omitted from `announce.needs` publishes-or-fails invisibly, and the crates
# leg (#2837) was added to it by hand with nothing enforcing the next one —
# so both graphs are checked here.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/ci-conclusion-complete.sh [<workflow> <sink>]...
#   No args: the built-in table below. Args: explicit workflow/sink pairs.
