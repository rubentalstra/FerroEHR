# ShellCheck over every shell program this repository WROTE.
#
# The tooling languages here are bash and Rust (.claude/rules/rust-style.md
# §No Python), and the Rust half has been lint-gated since the beginning while
# the bash half — the CI guards, the vendor fetchers, the deploy probes, the
# release machinery, the git hooks — had no static check at all. actionlint
# already shellchecks the `run:` blocks EMBEDDED in workflows, which is the
# smaller half: the scripts those blocks call were unchecked.
#
# Severity: `-S style`, the lowest floor ShellCheck offers, so everything
# gates. A finding is either fixed or carries a per-line
# `# shellcheck disable=SCnnnn` directive with its reason on the same line —
# never a blanket exclusion, and never a global disable (this repository has no
# .shellcheckrc for exactly that reason: a file that can turn a code off
# everywhere is a file that eventually does).
#
# Discovery is derived, not listed: every tracked `*.sh` plus every tracked
# extensionless file whose first line is a shell shebang. The second half is
# what covers `.githooks/commit-msg` — the one such program today — and covers
# the next hook the day it lands rather than the day someone remembers.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/shellcheck-lane.sh [<file>...]
#   no args  → every tracked shell program outside the vendored trees
#   <file>…  → just those files, at the same severity

# Vendored trees are upstream material, vendored verbatim by a
# scripts/vendor/*.sh fetcher and never hand-edited
# (.claude/rules/vendored-corpora.md) — a finding in one of them is not ours to
# fix, and editing it to silence this lane is forbidden by that rule. No
# vendored tree carries a shell program today; the exclusion is here so the
# first one that arrives cannot turn this lane red for something unfixable.
