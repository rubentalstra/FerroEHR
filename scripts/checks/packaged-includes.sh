# A packaged source file may only embed a file the PACKAGE carries.
#
# `include_str!`/`include_bytes!` resolve against the source file's directory,
# so a path reaching out of the crate (`../../tests/corpus/…`,
# `../../../../../openehr-its/tests/vendor/…`) compiles perfectly in this
# workspace and fails with "couldn't read file" for anyone who unpacks the
# published `.crate` and runs `cargo test` — the source is there, the fixture
# never was. `#[cfg(test)]` does not save it: the file still ships, and a
# consumer's test run still expands the macro.
#
# The packaged set comes from `cargo package --list`, which is the same
# computation the publish lane performs, rather than from reading the `include`
# list by eye. Every literal is resolved against the including file and must
# land inside that list; a non-literal include is reported rather than assumed
# safe, because this gate cannot evaluate it.
