# Changelog structure guard (Keep a Changelog 1.1.0).
#
# Fails when any release section of CHANGELOG.md (including [Unreleased])
# violates the Keep a Changelog structure:
#   1. a duplicated `### <Type>` subsection inside one release section
#      (each type appears at most once per section — new entries merge into
#      the existing subsection, they never append a second header);
#   2. a subsection header outside the canonical type set
#      (Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security).
#
# Wired into the CI changelog-guard job; runs unconditionally (the
# `no-changelog` escape label waives the entry REQUIREMENT, never the
# structural validity of the file).
