# The resolved-exception gate: no `[advisories].ignore` entry in `deny.toml` may
# outlive the finding it describes.
#
# `deny.toml`'s header states the rule in both directions, and this is the half
# no amount of reading keeps true: a dependency upgrade resolves an advisory, the
# ignore goes on passing because there is nothing left to ignore, and the
# published VEX justification keeps describing a dependency graph that no longer
# exists. That happened here — two quick-xml advisories accepted "via
# object_store, which pins ^0.40" stayed accepted after object_store moved to the
# patched 0.41.
#
# cargo-deny already detects the condition: `advisory-not-detected` fires for an
# `ignore` entry that no crate in the graph matches
# (https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/advisories/cfg.html). It is
# a WARNING by default, so `cargo deny check` stays green on one; this gate runs
# the check with that diagnostic promoted to an error and names the entries.
#
# Mutation-proven in both directions: a bogus ignore fails the gate naming its
# id, and removing it turns the gate green again.
