# scripts/checks/chart-appversion.sh — the committed chart release facts track
# the workspace version, the compose treatment (#2890).
#
# The committed `appVersion` equals the workspace version in Cargo.toml, bumped
# in the release PR beside the docker-compose.yml image tags — one sweep, one
# philosophy for both committed artifacts. The publish lane still injects
# `--app-version ${TAG#v}` and rewrites the `artifacthub.io/images` tags at
# package time (#2779); since the tree now carries the same value, the
# injection is belt-and-braces for the release leg and remains what makes the
# dispatch-driven `publish-chart.yml` recovery lane correct between releases.
#
# The one accepted cost (adjudicated on #2890, the same window the compose
# defaults have always accepted): between a release PR's merge and the tag's
# Containers leg publishing the X.Y.Z images, a from-tree `helm install`
# references image tags that do not exist yet. The window is ~30-60 minutes,
# exists only during a cut, and buys a tree whose committed versions never lag.
#
# Five properties, each with real content:
#
#   1. `appVersion` equals the workspace version (Cargo.toml is the authority,
#      the same source compose-image-tags.sh reads). A lagging default ships a
#      chart whose images predate the tree's own configuration vocabulary; a
#      diverging one means the release sweep missed a site.
#   2. Every FIRST-PARTY `artifacthub.io/images` tag equals `appVersion`. The
#      two describe one thing — the product version this chart defaults to —
#      and the package-time injection rewrites both from one input, so a tree
#      where they disagree would publish an annotation the package's own
#      appVersion contradicts. First-party means the images built from THIS
#      repository at this version: `ferroehr`, `ferroehr-viewer` and
#      `ferroehr-postgres` today. A third-party image the chart deploys —
#      `ghcr.io/rubentalstra/ferroterm` since #3305 — moves on its own release
#      line, is pinned in the chart's own values and helpers, and is neither
#      equal to appVersion nor rewritten at package time; holding it to this
#      rule would make every FerroEHR release claim a FerroTERM version that
#      does not exist.
#
#      WHICH entry is which is DECLARED, never inferred from the repository
#      name: each `image:` line in the annotation carries a trailing
#      `# party: first` or `# party: third` marker, and an unmarked line fails
#      this check. deploy/helm/release-facts.sh reads the same marker, so the
#      set rewritten at package time and the set checked here are one set by
#      construction. A name pattern would misclassify in both directions — a
#      future `ghcr.io/rubentalstra/ferroehr-<something>` built by somebody
#      else would be rewritten to our version, and a first-party image
#      published under another name would be left a release behind — and
#      neither mistake shows up in any render.
#   3. The third-party FerroTERM entry equals its own two sources: the TAG
#      equals `ferroehr.terminologyPinnedVersion` in _helpers.tpl (which the
#      `terminology.image.tag` default and the chart's tag-versus-digest
#      refusal both read), and the DIGEST equals `terminology.image.digest` in
#      values.yaml (which is what every install actually runs). Without this the
#      annotation is a fourth hand-maintained copy of a version: Artifact Hub
#      would scan whatever `ferroterm:<tag>` had moved to while the chart
#      deployed a pinned digest, and the vulnerability report would describe
#      software nobody is running.
#   4. Chart.yaml carries NONE of the injected annotations. A committed
#      `artifacthub.io/changes`, `containsSecurityUpdates` or `prerelease` key
#      would collide with the injected one and leave the packaged metadata
#      depending on YAML key-collision behaviour.
#   5. The chart README — a GENERATED file, and the one Artifact Hub renders as
#      the package front page — restates the same appVersion. It is generated
#      FROM Chart.yaml, so a disagreement means it was never regenerated.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/chart-appversion.sh [--self-test]
#   --self-test mutates a COPY of the chart tree six ways — a first-party tag
#   moved off appVersion, an image line with its party marker removed, and each of
#   the FerroTERM tag and digest moved off its pin from either side (the
#   annotation, the helper, the values file) — and asserts the guard rejects each.
#   The detectors are arithmetic over text, and a text detector never shown to fail
#   is a green light nobody has tested (reliability.md §enforcement tiers).
# Callers: the `chart-appversion` job in ci.yml, and the `plan` job of
# release.yml (which re-runs the whole guard tier at the tagged commit; plan
# separately asserts the tag equals the workspace version, so property 1 there
# transitively pins appVersion == ${TAG#v}).
