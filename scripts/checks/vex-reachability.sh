# The dependency-path gate: every VEX statement's claim about HOW the affected
# crate enters the build is compared against the graph cargo resolves.
#
# The two gates beside this one both pass on a false statement. The generator
# and `scripts/checks/vex-advisories.sh` check that the accepted id set and the
# published justifications agree; `scripts/checks/advisory-exceptions.sh` checks
# that each accepted advisory still fires. Neither reads the ARGUMENT. The `rsa`
# statement asserted the crate was reached only through `openidconnect`, in a
# path where RSA is used to verify with a public key — while `cargo tree -i rsa`
# had shown a second path through `pgp`, where an RSA operation would be a
# private-key one, the exact operation the advisory is about. Every gate was
# green, because a wrong path claim is only wrong against the dependency graph
# and nothing compared the two.
#
# WHAT IS COMPARED, AND WHY AT THIS LEVEL. Per statement, two exact sets, in
# both directions (a named crate the graph lacks fails; a crate in the graph the
# statement does not name fails):
#
#   direct_dependents  the crates depending DIRECTLY on the affected package —
#                      depth 1 of `cargo tree -i`. This is the level the rsa
#                      defect lived at: `pgp` was a direct dependent all along.
#   workspace_roots    the workspace members the package is reachable from.
#
# Not full paths, and not the intermediate crates between the two. `cargo tree`
# DE-DUPLICATES: a package already displayed is repeated as `(*)` with its
# dependencies omitted (`cargo tree --no-dedupe`,
# https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-tree.html). So its output
# enumerates every NODE exactly, while the set of PATHS it prints is partial —
# and both sets above are node-set facts, invariant under de-duplication, where
# a per-path comparison would be reading structure the output does not carry.
#
# THE GRAPH. `--workspace --all-features --target all -e normal,build,dev`: the
# widest graph cargo can resolve, because a published reachability claim must
# hold for every configuration a consumer can build, not only the default one.
# That is a superset of what `cargo deny` resolves (deny.toml sets no `[graph]`
# overrides, so it takes default features), which is the safe direction: this
# gate can only require a statement to account for MORE of the graph than the
# advisory gate itself sees. `--target all` also makes the answer
# host-independent, so a developer's macOS run and CI's Linux run agree.
#
# THE INPUT is the PUBLISHED document, not the prose file it is generated from:
# it is what a downstream scanner ingests, it needs no TOML reader in this job,
# and `vex-advisories.sh` already fails if it is not exactly what the prose
# generates.
#
# Mutation-proven in both directions: adding a carrier no graph edge supports
# fails naming it, and removing a real one fails naming the unlisted path.
