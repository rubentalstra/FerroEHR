# Default-value style guard (owner directive 2026-08-06; the shape of RFC 3681,
# https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3681-default-field-values.html).
#
# A field's default value belongs in ONE hand-written `impl Default` for its
# struct, written inline:
#
#     impl Default for OidcConfig {
#         fn default() -> Self {
#             Self { clock_skew_leeway_seconds: 60, allow_insecure_issuer: false }
#         }
#     }
#
# with container-level `#[serde(default)]` so serde fills omitted fields from it.
# That is exactly what RFC 3681's `clock_skew_leeway_seconds: u64 = 60` expands
# to; the syntax itself is nightly-only (feature `default_field_values`,
# https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/132162), so we hand-write the
# expansion and this guard keeps the tree in that shape.
#
# Three forms fail:
#   1. `#[serde(default = "path")]`  — the per-field path form. The default then
#      lives in a function instead of the Default impl, so `Default::default()`
#      and a deserialized value can disagree.
#   2. `fn default_<field>()`        — a helper whose only purpose is one field's
#      default value.
#   3. `const DEFAULT_<X>` with exactly ONE reference — a constant that is not
#      shared is just a default value spelled far from its struct.
#
# What stays legal: a `const` with MORE THAN ONE consumer (a spec-fixed value
# like `service::DEFAULT_SYSTEM_ID`), referenced from inside a Default impl; and
# `#[serde(default)]` with no path, which is the required form.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/default-style.sh [--all | <file>...]
#   no args  → the files changed against origin/main
#   --all    → every .rs file, tracked or untracked (unignored)

# `Option::default` and `Vec::default` are std paths, not project helpers: they

# not a second home for a value. They are reported as a hint, never a failure.
