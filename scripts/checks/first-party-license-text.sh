# WHY THIS IS LOCAL AND NOT `customLicenseSearch` IN .fossa.yml: that feature was
# tried and removed on 2026-08-12 (CLI 3.17.16). It could not upload at all
# (`archiveAndLicenseUpload is not enabled in this organization`, failing the
# lane after a clean analysis), and it did not honour the `paths.exclude` list —
# all seven of its hits were inside vendored third-party trees that list already
# excludes. A gate that reads the wrong files and cannot report is worse than no
# gate; this one shares that exclusion list and fails the build.
#
# Third-party material is EXCLUDED, not exempted: it is redistributed verbatim
# under terms recorded in each tree's PROVENANCE.md. Its licences are facts
# about somebody else's work, and flagging them here would say this project
# adopted them.
