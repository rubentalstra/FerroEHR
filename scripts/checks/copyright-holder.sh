# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Vernum Projecten B.V.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1
# One copyright holder, stated identically everywhere it is stated.
#
# `LICENSE` once said one holder while `REUSE.toml`, the codegen header constant
# and 2470 file headers said "FerroEHR contributors" (#2325). The Business
# Source License names Vernum Projecten B.V. as the Licensor and copyright
# holder (#3435), so every source states that. Asserting two holders means a
# downstream redistributor reading a file
# header and a lawyer reading LICENSE come away with different answers about who
# holds the copyright — the exact ambiguity per-file licensing exists to remove.
#
# The divergence survived because nothing compared the sources. This compares
# seven: the three that state the holder in a machine-readable field (`LICENSE`,
# `REUSE.toml`, the emitter constant) and the four that state it in prose a
# reader is handed — the published licensing page, which states it twice, and
# the `README.md` of each hand-written engine crate, which ships inside the
# published package (#3438).
#
# NOT compared: `CITATION.cff` authors and `.zenodo.json` creators. Those record
# AUTHORSHIP for citation, which is a different datum from the copyright holder
# and is correctly a named person. Nor `LICENSES/MIT.txt`, which reproduces the
# grant the MIT-published versions carry and keeps the holder they were
# published under.
