# Access-layer provenance guard (owner directive 2026-08-06, issue #1963).
#
# The authentication/authorization layer is OUR OWN DESIGN, grounded in the IETF
# OAuth2/JOSE RFCs, NIST SP 800-162 (ABAC), ANSI/INCITS 359 (Core RBAC) and the
# OWASP cheat sheets. Its comments must say so — not compare the behaviour to
# another product, and not carry internal phase markers.
#
# Three refusals, each a class the #1963 sweep removed:
#   1. `EHRbase` / `v1 parity` / `v1-compatible` — another product is prior art,
#      never the reason a rule exists. Every rationale cites an RFC, a standards
#      publication, or the vendored openEHR text under docs/specs/openehr/.
#   2. `Stage-1` / `Stage-2` — plan-phase vocabulary that outlived its plan and
#      says nothing to a reader (`.claude/rules/comments.md` bans phase markers).
#   3. a `CLAUDE.md` citation — internal markdown moves and dies, so it is never
#      an authority (the spec-adherence hard rule).
#
# Scope is the access layer plus its configuration, because that is where the
# stale attribution lived and where a rationale is most load-bearing.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/access-provenance.sh
