# Migration-citation guard: a Rust source under app/ may only cite a migration
# file that exists in the tree.
#
# A comment naming `0001_baseline.sql` used to point at the relation it
# described. The storage rewrite deleted that file, and eight comments went on
# citing it (#3418), which sends the next reader to a path that is not there and
# tells them nothing about where the relation is now defined.
#
# The check: every `NNNN_<name>.sql` token in a scanned file must match some
# file under app/ferroehr/migrations/ by path suffix, so `0006_definitions.sql`,
# `clinical/0006_definitions.sql` and `migrations/clinical/0006_definitions.sql`
# all resolve, and a deleted or misspelled one does not.
#
# Scope, and its limit: tracked `*.rs` under `app/`. Markdown is deliberately
# out of scope — the plans, the agent memory and the root CLAUDE.md discuss the
# first generation's files as history, and a guard that refused those would be
# refusing accurate prose.
#
# Exemptions are per FILE, each with its reason, below.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/migration-citations.sh [--all | --self-test | <file>...]
#   no args     → the changed .rs files under app/
#   --all       → every tracked .rs file under app/
#   --self-test → runs the guard over a fixture citing a migration that does not
#   exist and over one citing a migration that does, and asserts the first is
#   rejected and the second accepted. A text detector never shown to fail is a
#   green light nobody has tested (reliability.md §enforcement tiers).

# `db/mod.rs` IS the boot refusal for a first-generation database: it names that
# generation's opening files because sqlx records the file name as the recorded
# description, so the names are the signature it matches on.
#
# `ext_functions.rs` cites the first generation's helper file at the `v4.3.0`
# tag, where it still exists; the same test asserts its embedded copy equals
# `git show v4.3.0:…` byte for byte, so the citation is machine-checked.
