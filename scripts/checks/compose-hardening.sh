# Compose hardening guard (OWASP Docker Security Cheat Sheet; issues #1993–#2001).
#
# The Kubernetes path is hardened by `deploy/helm/ferroehr/values.yaml`, which a
# golden-render test pins. The Compose path had no equivalent, so this is it:
# every committed compose artifact must keep the isolation posture, and the
# quickstart must not publish a port on every interface.
#
# What each rule prevents:
#
#   1. `cap_drop: [ALL]` on every service — the default set grants ~14
#      capabilities, most of which no service here uses. A container that never
#      needs CAP_NET_RAW should not be able to forge packets if it is compromised.
#   2. `no-new-privileges:true` — blocks a setuid binary inside the container from
#      raising privileges, the Kubernetes `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
#      equivalent.
#   3. No `privileged: true`, ever — it hands over the host.
#   4. No `seccomp=unconfined` / `apparmor=unconfined` — Docker applies its
#      default seccomp profile unless overridden, and overriding it removes a
#      block on ~44 syscalls (docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp). The
#      posture is kept by the ABSENCE of the override, so absence is what is
#      checked.
#   5. No `/var/run/docker.sock` mount — the daemon socket is root on the host
#      (docs.docker.com/engine/security: "only trusted users should be allowed to
#      control your Docker daemon").
#   6. Published ports bind an explicit host address — a port published on
#      0.0.0.0 is DNAT'd ahead of the host firewall's chains, so `ufw deny` does
#      not stop it (docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls).

  # (1)+(2) every service DEFINITION declares the isolation floor.
  #
  # Only a block that declares `image:` or `build:` is a definition; a block
  # carrying just `environment:` or `configs:` is an OVERLAY that extends a
  # service defined elsewhere, and Compose merges the two — so the base file's
  # `cap_drop` already applies and repeating it in the overlay would be
  # duplication that can drift
  # (docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/multiple-compose-files/merge).
  #
  # A service named in BOTH the base file and an overlay is likewise exempt in the
  # overlay, even when the overlay restates `image:` (which
  # `docker-compose.override.yml` does to swap in the from-source tags): Compose
  # merges the two definitions, and restating `security_opt` there is not merely
  # redundant — it makes `docker compose config` fail with "items at 0 and 1 are
  # equal", because list-valued keys concatenate.
