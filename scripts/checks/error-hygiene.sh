# Error-body hygiene guard (OWASP REST Security Cheat Sheet, issue #2021):
# "Do not pass technical details (e.g. call stacks or other internal hints) to
# the client."
#
# The cheat sheet's first sentence — "respond with generic error messages" — is
# deliberately NOT followed here, and this guard encodes the distinction that
# replaces it.
#
# A 4xx describes the CLIENT's request, and specificity there is a feature: the
# strict canonical reader names the JSON path it refused, the AQL engine names
# the construct it cannot plan, the AOM2 validator returns catalogue codes.
# Integrators building against a standard this large need that, and none of it
# is internal information — it is a restatement of what the caller sent.
#
# A 5xx describes the SERVER, and specificity there is a leak: an `sqlx::Error`
# reaching a body would disclose schema and SQL, a `reqwest::Error` would
# disclose an internal terminology-server URL, and a formatted `thiserror`
# chain discloses whatever its innermost source knows. Those details belong on
# the trace record, where the operator reads them, and nowhere else.
#
# So the rule is one-directional: a 5xx constructor must not interpolate an
# error value. The tree satisfies this today (the storage boundary substitutes a
# fixed message per SQLSTATE class and logs the driver error; the terminology
# client's `provider_fault` keeps the upstream diagnostic off the wire), and
# this guard is what keeps it true as new error paths are added.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/error-hygiene.sh

# The guarded constructors:
#
#   - `ApiError::Internal` / `ApiError::ServiceUnavailable` — the 5xx bodies.
#     (`ValidationFailed` and `NotImplemented` carry no free-form string.)
#   - `Health::down` / `Health::degraded` — the health family is ALWAYS-ON and
#     UNAUTHENTICATED for orchestrator probes, so its `detail` is the most
#     exposed string the server emits. Two indicators used to interpolate the
#     raw `sqlx::Error` there, whose Display can name the DSN host, the
#     database, the role or SQL text (found and fixed under issue #2022).

error-hygiene: a 5xx error body or a health `detail` interpolates an error value —
that can carry SQL, a DSN, a filesystem path, an internal URL or a whole
thiserror chain to a client (and the health family is unauthenticated).
Substitute a fixed message and put the detail on the trace record instead (see
`classify_sqlx` in app/ferroehr/src/storage/error.rs for the pattern). A 4xx may
keep its specific, client-facing detail; only 5xx is guarded.
