# Every first-party shell, SQL and YAML file states its licensing INSIDE itself.
#
# The sibling gate `spdx-headers.sh` does this for Rust. This one exists rather
# than extending it because the two populations differ in three ways at once:
# the comment syntax (`#` and `--`, not `//`), the placement (a shebang must
# stay on line 1), and the licensing (these files are plain MIT — none carries
# openEHR specification text, so the dual-licence rule the Rust gate applies to
# the published spec crates has nothing to act on here). One gate with a mode
# matrix would be harder to read than two that each do one thing.
#
# WHY HEADERS AT ALL, when `REUSE.toml` already covers the tree by glob: a glob
# declaration does not travel with a copied file. REUSE 3.3 exists for exactly
# that property. The sharpest case here is `app/ferroehr/migrations/*.sql` — a
# migration lifted into another project is precisely the kind of file that gets
# copied, and it would arrive with no licence statement at all.
#
# SCOPE: tracked `.sh`, `.sql`, `.yml`. Vendored trees and third-party corpora
# are excluded, not exempted — a header there would assert something about
# somebody else's file. `.yaml` is deliberately NOT covered: that population is
# the CNF catalogue (data, thousands of files), and the Helm templates, where a
# `#` comment renders into `helm template` output and would change what users
# see.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/checks/spdx-headers-text.sh          # verify
#   scripts/checks/spdx-headers-text.sh --fix    # insert missing headers
