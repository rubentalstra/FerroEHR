# A published crate's tests never read the application tree (#3408).
#
# The nine `crates/openehr-*` packages publish to crates.io and the
# dependency arrows point one way: `app/*` reads `crates/*`, never the
# reverse. A test that opens `../../app/ferroehr/tests/resources/...` breaks
# that in the one place the compiler cannot see it, because the path is a
# string. The crate then cannot be tested from its own package, and the
# application cannot move a fixture without breaking a sibling's suite.
#
# Shared material lives under `corpus/`, which every side reaches by a
# workspace-relative path of its own.
#
# Scope is the RUST sources under `crates/*/tests/`, because those are what
# resolve a path at run time. The crate sources are out of scope: they have no
# business naming a path outside their package either, and `cargo package`
# already holds them to it. So is the prose beside the fixtures. A
# `PROVENANCE.md` that names the application test which commits a corpus body
# is a record, not a read.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/crate-tests-read-no-app.sh [--self-test]
#   no args     → every tracked Rust source under crates/*/tests/
#   --self-test → prove the detector in both directions
