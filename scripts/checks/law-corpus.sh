# The vendored legal texts are the bytes their records say they are.
#
# `docs/law/` exists so a compliance claim resolves to a fixed referent instead
# of to whatever a publisher's page says today. That only holds while three
# things stay true, and none of them is self-enforcing:
#
#   1. every vendored file still hashes to the digest its `SHA256SUMS` records
#      — a hand edit, a partial re-fetch or a git-side accident is otherwise
#      invisible, and the act would quietly stop being the act;
#   2. every act directory carries a `PROVENANCE.md`, and one with vendored
#      files carries a `SHA256SUMS` — an unrecorded text has no identifier, no
#      consolidation date and no licence, which is worse than not having it;
#   3. the record and the directory agree in both directions: a file the record
#      names exists, and a file that exists is covered by the digests.
#
# It also checks that every act directory is linked from `docs/law/README.md`,
# because an index nobody is forced to update is an index that goes stale, and
# the index is where a reviewer starts.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK, labelled rather than implied: nothing here can judge
# whether a vendored consolidation is still the CURRENT one upstream, or
# whether a `PROVENANCE.md` describes its file truthfully. Re-pinning is a
# deliberate act (change the script, re-run it, review the diff), and the
# records are review-enforced prose.
#
# The NEN directories are the deliberate exception to rule 2's second half:
# they hold a record and no text, because the standard is sold under copyright
# and may not be vendored. A directory with no vendored files needs no digests.
