# No Python in this repository (owner hard rule, 2026-08-10).
#
# The tooling languages are bash and Rust. Python is banned everywhere —
# standalone scripts, and especially embedded in shell, where it is worse than
# either language alone: a heredoc nested in a command substitution makes bash
# scan the Python for quote pairs, so ONE apostrophe in a comment breaks the
# whole script. That happened while writing scripts/render/zenodo-json.sh, and
# it is the concrete reason this rule is machine-enforced rather than advisory.
#
# There are no exemptions. The last two — the Helm selector-immutability and
# restricted-profile gates — parsed multi-document YAML and were converted to
# yq + jq under #2220, every assertion re-proven against the same mutations it
# caught before.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/no-python.sh
