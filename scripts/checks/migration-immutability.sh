# A migration that has SHIPPED is never edited (owner rulings 2026-09-09 and
# 2026-09-15).
#
# sqlx records a checksum of every applied migration and refuses a database
# whose recorded checksum no longer matches the file on disk, so editing a
# migration an installation has applied does not change history: it locks that
# installation out of its own database at boot, with an error about a checksum
# rather than about the edit.
#
# SHIPPED means present at the latest release tag reachable from the branch
# point (`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, the tags the release procedure cuts). A
# file that is on the base branch but in no release yet has been applied by no
# installation: it is rewrite material, and it is fixed in the file that
# defines it rather than papered over by a follow-up file (owner ruling
# 2026-09-15: the rewrite is breaking changes only, no rename migrations, no
# placeholder roles, no compatibility paths). The rule therefore re-arms by
# itself at every release cut, and needs no escape-hatch label. For a shipped
# file a schema change is a NEW file; a shipped migration that turned out wrong
# is superseded by a later one, never rewritten.
#
# RETIRING A WHOLE SET IS THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT AN EDIT, and it is accepted
# only in the shape that keeps an installation told rather than locked out:
#
#   * every SHIPPED file of `app/ferroehr/migrations/<schema>/` is gone at head,
#     so no half-set survives for a database to apply against. New
#     files may appear in the same directory: a schema NAME can outlive the set
#     that used it, and re-authoring `ext`, `linkage` or `audit` is exactly that.
#     What may not survive is any file of the old set, edited or untouched.
#   * `<schema>` is named in `FIRST_GENERATION_SETS` in
#     `app/ferroehr/src/db/mod.rs` at head, which is the table the server's boot
#     refusal reads: a database carrying that set's bookkeeping is refused by
#     name, with the remedy, instead of failing on a checksum.
#
# Both halves are machine-checked here, so the acceptance cannot be claimed by
# a comment or a label. For shipped files a single-file edit, a rename, a
# partial turnover, or a whole-set turnover whose schema the boot refusal does
# not name stays refused. When no release tag is reachable (a shallow clone),
# every base file counts as shipped: the conservative reading.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/checks/migration-immutability.sh --diff <base> [head]
#   scripts/checks/migration-immutability.sh --self-test
