# The licence-free shaped terminology seed has ONE canonical home — the
# directory the compose stack and the conformance lane mount,
# docker/terminology/seed/ — and one copy: the Helm chart carries it under
# files/terminology/ so `terminology.enabled=true` renders a ConfigMap without
# a repository checkout (a chart's `.Files` may only read files packaged with
# the chart, so a symlink or a path outside the chart directory cannot serve
# here). This guard holds the two byte-identical, in both directions: a file
# added, removed or edited on either side fails until the other follows.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/terminology-seed-drift.sh   (no arguments)
