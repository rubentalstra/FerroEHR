# Every pull request from a person records acceptance of the contribution
# licensing terms (CONTRIBUTING.md § Licensing of contributions).
#
# The terms turn a contribution into part of one Licensed Work under one
# Licensor; a merge without a recorded acceptance is a line whose relicensing
# right was never granted. A checkbox in the pull request template is the
# record, and this gate is what makes it binding: a body without the ticked
# line fails, whether the box was left empty or the section deleted.
#
# Bots cannot accept terms, and their changes carry no copyrightable expression
# of their own (dependency and pin bumps); the workflow skips them by author
# type before this script runs.
