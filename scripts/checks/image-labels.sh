# Image-metadata guard: the OCI annotation keys are declared once, correctly, and
# the two places that declare them agree.
#
# Three defects motivated this, all found on the published images (#2146):
#
#   * No annotations existed at all. A LABEL lives in the image config blob; an
#     ANNOTATION lives in the manifest or the index. GHCR reads a package's
#     description from the INDEX annotation, so three images carrying a perfectly
#     good description LABEL all displayed "No description provided".
#   * Six of the spec's fourteen predefined keys were unset, including
#     `documentation` (we publish a docs site and never pointed at it) and
#     `base.name`/`base.digest`, whose values were already pinned in the `FROM`.
#   * All three Dockerfiles declared `licenses="Apache-2.0"` for a then-MIT project.
#     That was invisible on GHCR because `build-push-action`'s `labels:` input
#     overrides a Dockerfile LABEL, so CI published the correct licence — and
#     anyone building the Dockerfile directly, the documented compose path,
#     shipped an image asserting a licence the project does not use.
#
# The third is the one this guard exists for. The same metadata is declared in
# two places — the Dockerfile, so a direct build is correct, and the publishing
# workflow, whose repository-derived defaults are wrong for a repo that ships
# three images (title comes from the repo NAME, so all three would claim to be
# "FerroEHR"). Two declarations of one fact drift; this makes them fail instead.
#
# EVERY workflow that declares them is checked, not one: the main lane
# (containers.yml) and the release pipeline (release.yml) each carry the three
# `uses: build-image.yml` calls with their labels (#2776), so a label corrected
# in one of them alone would publish a differently-described image at a release
# than on main.
#
# Ownership, which is what the checks below encode:
#   build-INDEPENDENT (title, description, url, documentation, source, vendor,
#     authors, licenses, base.name, base.digest) — both places, identical values
#   build-DEPENDENT (created, version, revision, ref.name) — the workflow only,
#     since a Dockerfile cannot know them
#   ref.name — deliberately unset; see the waiver below
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/image-labels.sh
