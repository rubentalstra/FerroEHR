# The FHIR probe family (#2178, #2158).
#
# FHIR is two integrations behind one config block, and they have OPPOSITE
# privacy postures — which is the whole reason this family exists:
#
#   fhir.api_enabled  mounts the inbound /fhir/r4/* routes. Off by default, and
#                     the documented off-state is a 404 rather than a 403: an
#                     unmounted route is not a refused one.
#   fhir.outbound     publishes the MAPPED FHIR RESOURCE — PHI, deliberately —
#                     to its OWN exchange (`ferroehr.fhir`), kept separate from
#                     the PHI-free events exchange precisely so broker-level
#                     access control can tell them apart.
#
# The probes assert that difference in both directions. An events envelope that
# gained clinical content and a FHIR resource that lost it are both defects, and
# a suite that only ever checked one direction would bless either.
#
# Sourced by scripts/deploy-probe.sh; never run directly.
