# The terminology probe family (#2178, #2158) — against a REAL terminology
# server, with REAL content.
#
# The temptation here is a seeded code system of our own: cheap, fast, and
# worthless. Passing `$validate-code` against a CodeSystem we wrote proves our
# client can talk to our own fixture. `$subsumes` is the clearest case — a
# subsumption answer means nothing without a real hierarchy behind it, and a
# fixture hierarchy is one we authored to make the test pass.
#
# So this family drives Snowstorm (SNOMED International's own server, which
# implements the FHIR Terminology Module) loaded with a real SNOMED CT release.
#
# THE RELEASE IS NOT OURS TO SHIP, AND THIS FAMILY RUNS LOCALLY ONLY. The RF2
# package is licensed content under a SNOMED International Affiliate agreement:
# it cannot be committed here, fetched by CI, or baked into a published image.
# The operator supplies a local path:
#
#   FERROEHR_SNOMED_RF2=~/SnomedCT_ManagedServiceNL_PRODUCTION_NL1000146_*.zip
#
# Without it the family declares itself NOT EXERCISED rather than substituting a
# fixture — an honest gap beats a green row that measured our own data.
#
# The NETHERLANDS edition is the expected package. Whether a Managed Service
# edition package is complete on its own or is an extension that depends on the
# International Edition is not something Snowstorm documents, so this family
# does not assume: supply FERROEHR_SNOMED_RF2_INTL as well and it is imported to
# MAIN first, with the national package then loaded onto its own branch. With
# only one package, that package goes to MAIN and the run reports what it
# actually served.
#
# It is also heavy: Elasticsearch plus Snowstorm want ~8 GB and the import takes
# far longer than every other probe combined, so this family is opt-in.
#
# Elasticsearch specifically, and not a substitute: the maintainers were asked
# about OpenSearch and answered no, "mainly because Elasticsearch provides
# better performance" (IHTSDO/snowstorm#411), and Snowstorm has since moved to
# the ES 8 client, which OpenSearch — forked at 7.10 — cannot serve. Meilisearch
# is not a candidate at all: Snowstorm speaks the Elasticsearch query DSL, so
# that would be a rewrite rather than a swap. None of this reaches the product:
# Elasticsearch exists only inside this probe stack, to run the terminology
# server being measured, and never in anything FerroEHR ships.
#
# Sourced by scripts/deploy-probe.sh; never run directly.
