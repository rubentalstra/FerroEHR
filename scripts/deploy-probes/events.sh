# The events / AMQP outbox probe family (#2178, #2158).
#
# Two claims are made about this integration and neither had been demonstrated
# on a running system:
#
#   PHI-free  — the payload carries identity and provenance only: contribution
#               id, ehr_id, committed_at, and per version (vo_id, kind,
#               sys_version, change_type, template_id). Never clinical content.
#               That is a PRIVACY claim, so the probe reads the actual bytes off
#               the broker rather than trusting the type that built them.
#   never lose — the outbox is written inside the commit transaction and drained
#               afterwards, so a broker outage must not fail a commit and must
#               not drop the event. Testing that means taking the broker away
#               WHILE committing, which no unit test does.
#
# The far end is the broker: messages are read back through RabbitMQ's
# management API, because "the server logged that it published" is exactly the
# kind of evidence #2173 and #2175 proved worthless.
#
# Sourced by scripts/deploy-probe.sh; never run directly.

# that never existed looks exactly like an integration that never publishes.
# That produced three red rows blaming the server for the probe's own race.
