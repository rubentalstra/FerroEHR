# The VERSION-signing probe family (#2163).
#
# `[signing]` is on by default in `digest` mode with read-time verification
# `strict`, which means the server recomputes the signature of a version it
# signed on every read and refuses to serve a provably corrupt record. That is a
# strong claim, and it had never been watched work.
#
# The probes that matter are the TAMPER ones: a signing feature with no
# demonstrated detection is decoration. So they reach past the API into the
# stored rows, change a byte of clinical content, and assert it is caught — the
# only way to show the verification is real rather than a field nobody checks.
# There are two stored copies of a version's content and one probe per copy:
# vo_version.body, caught by the read path, and the node rows, caught by the
# admin storage-parity sweep.
#
# Sourced by scripts/deploy-probe.sh; never run directly.

# Run SQL against the composed database as the quickstart's role.
