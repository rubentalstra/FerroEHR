# The PGP signing probe family (#2163's second mode).
#
# #2163 is explicit that the PGP path must be exercised "with a real key,
# including the passphrase-file route, since that is the documented production
# shape". So this generates a real OpenPGP key, mounts it the way the
# configuration reference instructs — `signing.key_path` for the armored secret
# key, `signing.key_passphrase_file` for its passphrase — and drives the same
# assertions the digest family does, including tamper detection.
#
# The key is generated into a THROWAWAY keyring under the run's temp directory:
# a probe must never touch the operator's own GnuPG home.
#
# Sourced by scripts/deploy-probe.sh; never run directly.

PGP_PASS="probe-passphrase-not-a-secret"

# Generate an armored secret key, its PUBLIC half and its passphrase file into a
# named directory, echoing that directory. Empty output means gpg was
# unavailable or refused.
#
# The public half is exported because key ROTATION needs it: `retired_key_paths`
# takes public keys, so a retired key can verify history and can never sign
# again.
