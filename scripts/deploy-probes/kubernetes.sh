# The Kubernetes probe family (#2178's second platform).
#
# The compose family answers "does the software work when it is deployed". This
# one answers a question compose cannot reach at all: **does the cluster apply
# what the chart asked for?** Those are different claims, and only the second is
# what an operator running the chart actually gets. `helm template` proves the
# YAML we generate; the API server, the kubelet and the container runtime each
# get a say afterwards, and every one of them can decline.
#
# So every probe here observes at the far end of THAT chain:
#
#   - the security posture is read out of the container runtime's own spec, not
#     out of the pod manifest — an empty capability bounding set is a fact about
#     the kernel, whereas `drop: [ALL]` is a request;
#   - Pod Security admission is judged by the API server refusing or admitting,
#     not by us re-reading the profile;
#   - a mounted secret is proven READ by breaking its path and watching the boot
#     refuse, because a secret that is mounted and never read looks identical in
#     `kubectl describe`;
#   - readiness is proven to GATE by removing the database and watching the
#     EndpointSlice drop the pod, not by a probe that has only ever returned UP.
#
# The database runs in docker compose on the host and the chart is pointed at it
# (owner ruling): the chart provisions no database and takes an external DSN, so
# a host database is the faithful shape rather than a convenience — and an
# in-cluster `kubectl create deployment pg` has no volume, which turns any
# restart into an empty database and a diagnosis cycle.
#
# Sourced by scripts/deploy-probe-k8s.sh; never run directly.
