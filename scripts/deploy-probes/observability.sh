# The observability probe family (#2162, #2173, #2175).
#
# The far end here is deliberately awkward to reach, and that is the point. The
# defects this family nets were both invisible from the server side:
#
#   #2173 — the bundled Prometheus scraped NOTHING; the server was emitting
#           happily and no metric reached the stack.
#   #2175 — `metrics_push` exported 4 of 10 families: `ferroehr_build_info` and
#           the HTTP histogram never left the process.
#
# In both, `/management/prometheus` answered 200 with the metrics present. Any
# probe that asked the SERVER whether telemetry worked would have passed. So
# these ask the COLLECTOR.
#
# The overlay publishes only Grafana; Prometheus and Tempo stay on the compose
# network, so the queries go through Grafana's datasource proxy — which is also
# how an operator would check, making this the documented path rather than a
# back door.
#
# Sourced by scripts/deploy-probe.sh; never run directly.
