# Render website/book/src/compliance/control-matrix.md FROM the tracker.
#
# A hand-maintained compliance table is wrong the first time a control ships.
# This script reads the tracker instead: every issue whose body carries a
# structured line
#
#     Control: <legal source> <article or clause>
#
# becomes a row, joined to its legal source URL from the registry declared
# below and to its current status (shipped with the closing pull request,
# planned, or not planned). An issue may declare several controls, one per
# line.
#
# DETERMINISM. The rendered page is a pure function of tracker state: no
# clock, no HEAD commit, no run counter. The docs CI job re-runs this script
# with --check and fails when the committed page differs, so anything that
# changed between two runs of an unchanged tracker would fail the build every
# day. When the page was generated, and from which commit, is git history of
# the file itself.
#
# THE CLOSING PULL REQUEST. A control's row shows Shipped with its closing
# pull request once that PR has MERGED; an open PR that says `Closes #N`
# changes nothing, so opening one never stales the page. The one exception is
# deliberate: run with `--closing <pr>` and the issues that pull request closes
# render as Shipped with that PR already, so the PR that closes a control
# regenerates the page itself and the page is right the moment it merges. The
# CI job passes the pull request under check (#3253).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/render/control-matrix.sh                     write the page
#   scripts/render/control-matrix.sh --closing <pr>      write it as it will read once <pr> merges
#   scripts/render/control-matrix.sh --check [--closing <pr>]
#                                                        fail when the committed page is stale

# Fetch ceiling. The tracker holds ~2100 issues, so a low limit silently drops
# the older half of the matrix; the truncation guard below turns a tracker that
# outgrows this number into a loud failure rather than a short page.
FETCH_LIMIT=10000

# The legal-source registry: short name, jurisdiction, then the official
# publisher URL. A control naming a short name that is not declared here is a
# hard failure, so no page cell can ever carry free text where a citation
# belongs. Order here is the order the table groups by.
#
# The jurisdiction column is not decoration. openEHR is not a Dutch standard,
# and FerroEHR is deployed outside the Netherlands, so a page that lists Dutch
# law beside EU law without saying which is which reads as though every
# deployment answers to both (#3185). EU and INT apply everywhere; a
# two-letter code is national and applies to deployments in that country.
#
# Every URL here is checked BY HAND when it is added or changed, and the date
# recorded below. Nothing in CI can do it: the link checker runs with
# --offline deliberately, because a rate-limited publisher says nothing about
# the change under review (#2287). That is exactly how the NEN 7510 entry sat
# here returning 404 (#3177).
#
# Last checked, all 200: 2026-09-09.

# Control matrix

FerroEHR is software. It is not a controller, not a processor and not a
certified organisation, so this page makes no compliance claim on anyone's
behalf. It lists the technical controls the product ships or plans, and the
article or clause each one is designed to support. Whether a deployment
satisfies a legal obligation depends on how the deploying organisation runs
it.

Every row comes from the tracker. A control is declared on the issue that
delivers it, as a line in the issue body:

```text
Control: <legal source> <article or clause>
```

The short name resolves to an official publisher URL from a registry inside
the generator, so a legal citation on this page is never free text. An issue
may declare several controls, one per line.

## How this page is built

`scripts/render/control-matrix.sh` queries the tracker with the GitHub CLI,
joins each declared control to its legal source and to its current state, and
writes this file. A CI job re-runs the generator with `--check` and fails the
build when the committed page no longer matches the tracker, which is what
keeps a shipped control from sitting here as "planned".

- **Shipped:** the issue is closed as completed. The merged pull request that
  closed it is linked in the last column. The one pull request that closes a
  control regenerates this page as it will read after the merge, so the page
  never lags a shipped control.
- **Planned:** the issue is open. Whether work has started is the issue's
  column on the [public roadmap board](https://github.com/users/rubentalstra/projects/4),
  which this page does not copy: a status that lives in two places disagrees
  the day one of them moves.
- **Not planned:** the issue was closed without the control being built. The
  row stays visible so the record does not quietly lose it.

The page carries no generation timestamp and no build commit. Both change on
every run or every push while the tracker has not moved, which would make the
CI staleness check fail on days when nothing was wrong. When this page was
last regenerated, and from which commit, is the file's own git history.

The short names above resolve to these publishers. The linked text is the
authority; nothing on this page restates it.

  cat <<'SCOPE'

`EU` and `INT` apply to every deployment. A two-letter country code is
national law or a national standard, and applies to a deployment in that
country: FerroEHR is an openEHR CDR, openEHR is not a Dutch standard, and a
deployment elsewhere answers to its own equivalents rather than to these.
Adding a jurisdiction is a registry entry plus the controls that cite it.
