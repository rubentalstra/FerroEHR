# Render the storage-benchmark section for the book FROM the committed records
# (docs/benchmarks/storage/<generation>/record.json, #3367).
#
# The stale-numbers gate (scripts/checks/conformance-numbers.sh) forbids a
# hand-typed latency in the site sources, so the performance page includes this
# output instead; website/book/generated/ is render output and gitignored.
#
# COMMITTED records only. The harness writes a record on every run and the
# directory ignores them by default, so the page is a pure function of what the
# repository actually carries — a local exploration run never changes it, and
# `--check` means the same thing here as it does in CI.
#
# With no record committed the page says so. A benchmark page that silently
# renders nothing reads as though the numbers were withheld.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/render/storage-bench.sh            write the page
#   scripts/render/storage-bench.sh --check    fail when the page is missing or stale
