# Compare a fresh storage-benchmark record against the committed one for the
# same schema generation, and say per operation whether it moved (#3370).
#
# The harness (`app/ferroehr/benches/storage.rs`) writes its record over
# `docs/benchmarks/storage/<generation>/record.json`, which is where the
# committed baseline lives, so the baseline is read from `HEAD` rather than
# from the working tree: after a run the file on disk IS the fresh record.
#
# EXPLORATION, never a conformance record. Conformance is the CNF 2.0 suite
# Veredictum runs, whose artifacts live under `docs/conformance/<sut>/`.
# Nothing here earns a performance class, and a verdict below is a signal to
# investigate on the machine it was measured on, not a published number.
#
# Two records only compare when they measured the same corpus: `bench_class`
# sizes the seed, so an `s` baseline against a `poc` run is a different
# question, not a regression. When the classes differ every row reads
# `not compared` and the run stays green, with the reason in the summary.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/render/storage-bench-compare.sh [options]
#     --measured <file>    the fresh record (default: the newest
#                          docs/benchmarks/storage/*/record.json on disk)
#     --baseline <file>    the record to compare against (default: the
#                          measured record's generation, read from HEAD)
#     --tolerance <pct>    how far p50 or p99 may rise before the run fails
#                          (default 15)
#     --summary <file>     where the markdown table is written (default
#                          $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY, else stdout)
#     --runner <text>      the machine this run measured on, named in the
#                          summary so a red verdict is attributable
#   scripts/render/storage-bench-compare.sh --self-test
#
# Exit: 0 when nothing regressed beyond the tolerance (and 0 when there is no
# committed record to compare against), 1 when something did, 2 on a usage or
# input error.
