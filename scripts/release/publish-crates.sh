# The crates.io upload of the eight `openehr-*` spec crates, and its read-back,
# as ONE implementation.
#
# Two workflows publish these crates — the `crates` leg of `release.yml` on a
# `v*` tag (the primary path, approval-gated) and `publish-crates.yml` on a
# manual dispatch (the dry-run/recovery lane) — and they cannot share a reusable
# WORKFLOW. crates.io Trusted Publishing matches the OIDC `workflow_ref` claim,
# and for a job inside a reusable workflow that claim names the CALLING workflow
# (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/openid-connect and
# https://crates.io/docs/trusted-publishing), so a reusable workflow would
# present the caller's identity anyway while hiding which workflow file each
# Trusted Publisher entry has to name. The shared thing is therefore this
# script, and each workflow keeps its own job — and its own identity.
#
# WHY PER CRATE. `cargo publish --workspace` is all-or-nothing at the START — it
# refuses the whole run if ANY member version already exists — while being
# non-atomic at the END, so a partial publish cannot be finished by re-running
# it. Those two together stranded `openehr-its` and `openehr-adl` at 0.0.10
# while six siblings reached 0.0.15 (issue #2211). Publishing per crate in
# dependency order and treating "already exists" as done makes the lane
# RESUMABLE, and idempotent: a release whose cycle changed no packaged crate
# content publishes nothing and stays green.
#
# Usage:
#   publish-crates.sh publish   # upload each crate in dependency order
#   publish-crates.sh verify    # read the registry back, with retries
#   publish-crates.sh version   # print the lockstep version
#
# Requires: cargo, curl, jq. `publish` additionally requires
# CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN in the environment.
