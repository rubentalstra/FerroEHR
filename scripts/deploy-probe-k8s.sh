# The deployment-conformance harness, Kubernetes platform (#2178).
#
# The compose harness (scripts/deploy-probe.sh) measures whether the software
# works when deployed. This one measures something compose cannot see: whether
# the CLUSTER applies what the chart asked for. `securityContext` is a request,
# admission is a separate judge, and a mounted secret that is never read looks
# exactly like one that is — so each of those is observed at its own far end,
# from the container runtime, the API server and the EndpointSlice rather than
# from the manifest we wrote.
#
# The database is a docker compose PostgreSQL on the host that the chart is
# pointed at (owner ruling): the chart provisions no database and takes an
# external DSN, so a host database is the faithful shape, and an in-cluster pod
# with no volume turns any restart into an empty database.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/deploy-probe-k8s.sh                # install, probe, tear down
#   scripts/deploy-probe-k8s.sh --keep-up      # leave the release for poking at
#
# Env:
#   PROBE_K8S_IMAGE   repo:tag of the server image under probe. Defaults to a
#                     `dev-local` build if the node already has one, else the
#                     chart's appVersion. The chart's `config:` defaults track
#                     develop while appVersion names the last release, so a key
#                     added since that release makes the appVersion image refuse
#                     to boot — that is a real finding, and P-K8S-BOOT reports it
#                     against the chart rather than hiding it.
#   PROBE_K8S_ADMINUI_IMAGE
#                     repo:tag of the admin-console image. Defaults to the
#                     chart's own (appVersion), which is what an operator
#                     enabling adminUi.enabled gets.
#   PROBE_K8S_NS      namespace (default ferroehr-probe; created and deleted).
#   PROBE_OUT         where the machine-readable record lands.
