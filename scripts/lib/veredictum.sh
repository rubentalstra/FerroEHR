# The pinned conformance instrument: Veredictum.
#
# The acceptance instrument is no longer a sibling crate in this workspace. It
# is an independent project with its own release line, consumed here at a PIN
# recorded in exactly one place — VEREDICTUM_VERSION below. Everything that
# runs the catalogue sources this file and calls the two resolvers.
#
# Two halves, obtained separately because the publisher separates them:
#
#   the BINARY  `cargo install veredictum --version <pin> --locked`, from
#               crates.io. The published package carries source only; its
#               manifest `include` list is an allowlist of code and the legal
#               set, because the catalogue and the vendored spec oracle are
#               hundreds of megabytes of data no registry accepts.
#   the DATA    the catalogue (`artifacts/`) and the spec oracle
#               (`specs/openehr`, with the schema bundles beside it) come from
#               the repository at the tag matching the pin — a shallow, cached
#               checkout. There is no data tarball on the release, and the
#               release binaries are Linux-only, so this is the one path that
#               works on every machine that runs the pipeline.
#
# Both halves are cached under one version-keyed root, and both resolvers are
# idempotent: a warm machine re-runs them for the cost of a version check.
#
# Overrides, for an offline machine or a contributor working on the instrument
# itself (each is used verbatim and never fetched over):
#   VEREDICTUM_BIN   path to an existing `veredictum` binary
#   VEREDICTUM_ROOT  path to an existing Veredictum checkout (its `artifacts/`
#                    and `specs/` are read from there)
#   VEREDICTUM_CACHE cache root (default: $XDG_CACHE_HOME/ferroehr-veredictum,
#                    falling back to ~/.cache/ferroehr-veredictum)

# The pin. Bumping it is a deliberate change: the catalogue, the oracle and the
# verdict pipeline all move together, so a bump is re-proven by a full
# `scripts/conformance.sh` run against the committed baseline.
