# `cargo leptos` for the viewer, with the workspace lockfile frozen.
#
# Every other build in this repository runs `--locked`; the viewer's did not,
# and a viewer build re-resolved and rewrote Cargo.lock in the working tree
# (#2877). `cargo leptos` cannot simply be handed the flag: before it compiles
# anything it resolves the workspace through its own `cargo metadata` call
# (cargo_metadata's MetadataCommand, which cargo-leptos passes no extra flags
# to), and cargo exposes no environment variable for `--locked` — the
# environment-variables reference lists one only for `--offline`
# (CARGO_NET_OFFLINE), and an offline cargo still re-resolves from the local
# registry cache. Measured on the pinned toolchain: `cargo metadata` against a
# lockfile with one entry removed silently re-resolved it to a NEWER version.
#
# So the lock is frozen in two moves:
#   1. a `cargo metadata --locked` PRECHECK — it fails loud if the committed
#      lockfile does not already satisfy every manifest, and it runs before
#      cargo-leptos exists, so cargo-leptos's own unlocked metadata call then
#      finds nothing to change;
#   2. `--locked` passed through to both compile legs (`--lib-cargo-args` /
#      `--bin-cargo-args`), so neither can re-resolve either.
#
# Usage: scripts/cargo-leptos.sh build [--release] [...]
