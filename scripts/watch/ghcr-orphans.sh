# scripts/watch/ghcr-orphans.sh — enumerate GENUINELY unreachable GHCR manifests.
#
# WHY (#2779): every image push in this estate is push-by-digest followed by a
# separate tag application (scan-and-tag.yml). A run that dies between those two
# steps leaves a manifest in the registry that no tag and no index points at, and
# nothing in the estate prunes it — GHCR keeps it, and it keeps counting against
# the package's storage and its version list, forever.
#
# WHY A NAIVE UNTAGGED LIST IS USELESS HERE: on this repository ~80% of every
# package's versions are untagged and almost all of them are REACHABLE. A
# multi-arch image is a tagged INDEX whose per-architecture manifests carry no
# tags of their own; buildkit adds one attestation manifest per platform to that
# same index; and because GHCR serves no referrers API, cosign signatures and
# SLSA attestations reach the registry through the OCI fallback TAG
# `sha256-<hex>` — a tagged index whose children are, again, untagged. So this
# script computes reachability rather than reporting absence of a tag:
#
#   orphan = untagged AND not a child of any tagged index (at any depth)
#
# The tagged half comes from the GitHub packages API (which knows the tags), the
# child half from the OCI distribution API (which knows the indexes). Both are
# read-only.
#
# THIS SCRIPT NEVER DELETES, and the watcher that calls it never deletes either.
# Deletion is a manual, reviewed act: an automated prune that miscomputed
# reachability by one media type would destroy published attestations and
# signatures for releases that are immutable by policy, and the failure would be
# silent until a consumer's `gh attestation verify` returned a 404. The report
# lists the exact `gh api -X DELETE` command for each orphan instead.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/watch/ghcr-orphans.sh                 # report to stdout
#   scripts/watch/ghcr-orphans.sh --out report.md # also write the markdown body
#   scripts/watch/ghcr-orphans.sh --owner X --package Y   # narrow the sweep
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated, `read:packages`), jq, curl.
# Exits non-zero only when the PROBE cannot answer — an unreachable API, a
# manifest the registry refuses, an answer jq cannot read. Finding orphans is a
# successful run (the watcher family's run-colour law, #2778).

# Every backtick below is markdown in a report body, never command substitution.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
