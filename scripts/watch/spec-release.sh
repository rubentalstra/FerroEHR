# openEHR RELEASE watcher (tracker issue #179) — the companion of
# scripts/watch/spec-update.sh: that one tracks individual completed spec
# CHANGES; this one makes sure a component RELEASE event is never missed
# again (ITS-REST 1.1.0 shipped 19-Jul-2026 and was discovered by hand).
#
# Mechanism (surface verified live 2026-07-20): the upstream
# openEHR/specifications-* repos tag releases as `Release-X.Y.Z` (with
# occasional `Release-X.Y.ZvN` re-cut suffixes — same release, normalized
# away; SM/CNF/ITS-JSON have never tagged and are skipped). Per component:
# take the HIGHEST Release-* version, and file ONE issue when it is newer
# than our vendored pin — routed per the version policy
# (docs/VERSIONS.md §Spec version policy): minor of a pinned line →
# re-vendor checklist; MAJOR → per-component generation decision; ITS-REST →
# always-latest adoption umbrella.
#
# Backfill guard + watermark: a release is filed only when NEWER than the
# pin (comparable pins), and the issue board is the dedup — the component and
# the version must both appear in the title, over open AND closed issues, which
# also matches hand-made adoption umbrellas (e.g. #178 "Adopt ITS-REST 1.1.0 …"),
# so covered releases are never re-filed. No state file.
#
# Filing goes through the watcher family's one engine (#2778),
# .github/actions/file-watcher-issue/file-issue.sh, which owns the single dedup
# search idiom; this script keeps the probe — the tag poll, the version
# comparison and the routing.
#
# Failure honesty: a tags-API transport failure or unexpected shape is a RED
# run; an empty tag list on a never-tagged repo is a logged skip. A release
# FOUND is a green run that files work, per the family's run-colour rule.
#
# Env: DRY_RUN=1 (report, create nothing) · GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN for gh.

Upstream published a new **$comp** release: **Release-$latest**
(https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/$comp/Release-$latest · tag on openEHR/$repo).

- **Our vendored pin:** ${ref} @ ${sha:0:9}
- **Routing (docs/VERSIONS.md §Spec version policy):** $routing

### Checklist

- [ ] Read the release notes / amendment records for the delta vs our pin
- [ ] Re-vendor at the release tag (\`scripts/vendor/spec-docs.sh\` + codegen inputs where applicable) — or record the generation decision if this is a major
- [ ] Regenerate + implement behaviour deltas; update \`docs/VERSIONS.md\` (pin + release ladder)
- [ ] ECC zero-drift run at close

_Opened automatically by \`.github/workflows/spec-release-watcher.yml\`._
