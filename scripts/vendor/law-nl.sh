# Vendors the Dutch acts the compliance pages cite into docs/law/nl/, one
# directory per act, in the format wetten.overheid.nl serves, plus the records
# for the three NEN standards that may not be vendored at all.
#
# WHY THE TEXTS ARE IN THE TREE. Same reason as the EU layer
# (scripts/vendor/law-eu.sh): a compliance claim checked against a page fetched
# at review time is checked against whatever that page says on the day. A
# consolidation vendored at a named date is a fixed referent, and SHA256SUMS
# proves the bytes are the ones the script fetched.
#
# FORMAT AND PIN. wetten.overheid.nl serves a consolidated act as HTML at
# wetten.overheid.nl/<BWB-id>/<yyyy-mm-dd>, and that HTML is vendored verbatim
# as text.html. The date is pinned in the table below rather than resolved at
# run time, so a re-run reproduces the same consolidation instead of silently
# following the site to a newer one; each pin is the consolidation the
# undated URL redirected to when the pin was set.
#
# ONE THING THAT IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE, and it is the publisher's doing: the
# served page carries a "Geraadpleegd op <date>" line, so re-fetching on a
# later day changes the bytes even when the act has not changed a word. The
# SHA-256 recorded here is of the fetch this record names, not a property of
# the consolidation.
#
# LICENCE. Auteurswet Art. 11: no copyright subsists in laws, decrees and
# ordinances issued by the public authority. The article is quoted verbatim in
# LICENSES/LicenseRef-Auteurswet-Art11-Public-Domain.txt and declared for this
# subtree in REUSE.toml.
#
# THE NEN STANDARDS ARE NOT HERE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. NEN 7510-1:2024,
# NEN 7510-2:2024, NEN 7512:2022 and NEN 7513:2018 are sold under copyright by
# NEN. They are not fetched, not vendored, and not quoted. Each gets a
# PROVENANCE.md that says so, names the edition and the shop URL, and lists
# what the compliance pages cite, so a reviewer holding a licensed copy can
# follow every citation.
#
# Idempotent: each act directory is wiped and re-fetched, each NEN record is
# rewritten from this script.

## Files

| file | bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| \`text.html\` | $bytes | \`$digest\` |

The HTML wetten.overheid.nl serves for this consolidation, byte for byte.
Nothing was converted or extracted: an extraction is an edit, and an edited act
is no longer the publisher's text.

The served page stamps its own consultation date into the markup, so re-running
the script on a later day changes these bytes even if the act has not changed a
word. The digest above is of the fetch this record names.

## Licence

No copyright subsists in this text. Auteurswet Art. 11: *"Er bestaat geen
auteursrecht op wetten, besluiten en verordeningen, door de openbare macht
uitgevaardigd, noch op rechterlijke uitspraken en administratieve
beslissingen."* The article is quoted in
\`LICENSES/LicenseRef-Auteurswet-Art11-Public-Domain.txt\` and declared for
this subtree in \`REUSE.toml\`.

Do not hand-edit anything in this directory. Re-run
\`scripts/vendor/law-nl.sh\` instead — a hand edit makes the SHA256SUMS line a
lie, which is the one thing a vendored legal text may never be.

## What the compliance pages cite

The citations are to a PART and a control THEME rather than to a numbered
clause: the pages state which half of the standard an obligation sits in and
which control family it belongs to, never a clause number. A reviewer with a
licensed copy follows them by control family.

| Cited as | Where | What the page claims against it |
|---|---|---|
| NEN 7510-1, the information security management system | \`website/book/src/compliance/shared-responsibility.md\`, \`website/book/src/compliance/index.md\` | The software supplies technical controls an ISMS can point at; running the ISMS, and holding any certificate, is the deployment's |
| NEN 7510-2, the control set | \`website/book/src/compliance/shared-responsibility.md\`, \`website/book/src/compliance/index.md\` | Access control, audit logging, cryptography in transit and for version signatures, supply-chain verification |
| NEN 7510-2, cryptographic controls | \`website/book/src/security/dpia.md\` | National identifiers sealed and looked up by keyed digest, resolved under audit |

## Why the citations still work without the text

The claims above are claims about THIS software, checkable in this repository:
the control is in the code, its behaviour is in the tests, and the page names
which. What the standard requires is checkable only against the standard, by
someone who holds it. That split is the reason this record exists instead of a
copy.

## What the compliance pages cite

This is the one standard of the three whose citations reach a numbered clause.

| Cited as | Where | What the page claims against it |
|---|---|---|
| §5, the content of a logged event | \`website/book/src/audit.md\` (the field-by-field table) | Every item the clause lists is mapped to the field of the access record that carries it, including the two a deployment must supply itself (\`purpose\`, \`legal_basis\`) |
| Actor role | \`website/book/src/compliance/control-matrix.md\`, \`website/book/src/security/dpia.md\` | The access record carries the roles the caller held at access time, as FHIR \`agent.role\` and as a DICOM \`RoleIDCode\` |
| Event content | \`website/book/src/compliance/control-matrix.md\`, \`website/book/src/security/dpia.md\`, \`website/book/src/security/records-of-processing.md\` | Per-domain access logging for reads and queries, aligned with this standard and EHDS Annex II 3.2 |
| Retention | \`website/book/src/audit.md\`, \`website/book/src/compliance/control-matrix.md\`, \`website/book/src/security/dpia.md\` | The retention floor for the NL jurisdiction, which the Besluit vaststelling bewaartermijn logging binds to this standard |

The retention chain is followable without holding the standard, because the
legal end of it is vendored: \`docs/law/nl/begz/\` (Art. 5 delegates the
period) and \`docs/law/nl/besluit-bewaartermijn-logging/\` (the period is five
years from the moment the log line is written).

## Why the citations still work without the text

The claims above are claims about THIS software, checkable in this repository:
the recorded fields are in the schema and in the tests, and the page names
which field answers which item. What the standard requires of the item list is
checkable only against the standard, by someone who holds it.
