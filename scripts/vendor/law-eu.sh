# Vendors the EU legal acts the compliance pages cite into docs/law/eu/, one
# directory per act, in the format its publisher serves.
#
# WHY THE TEXTS ARE IN THE TREE. The compliance pages make claims against
# named articles of named acts. A claim checked against a page fetched at
# review time is checked against whatever that page says on the day, and
# neither the reviewer nor a later reader can tell whether the text moved
# underneath the citation. A consolidation vendored at a named date is a fixed
# referent: the citation resolves to bytes this repository carries, and the
# SHA256SUMS beside them proves they are the bytes this script fetched.
#
# FORMAT AND ENDPOINT. The English act is fetched as XHTML from the
# Publications Office content-negotiation URI,
# publications.europa.eu/resource/celex/<celex> with
# `Accept: application/xhtml+xml`, and vendored verbatim as text.html. Nothing
# is converted, reformatted or extracted: an extraction is an edit, and an
# edited act is no longer the publisher's text.
#
# It is deliberately NOT the eur-lex.europa.eu web page, which serves the same
# document wrapped in site chrome that includes a bot-detection script tag
# carrying a per-request agent id. Two fetches of the identical, unchanged act
# then differ, so a re-run could never reproduce the vendored bytes and the
# recorded digest would stop meaning anything. The Cellar URI answers the same
# document byte for byte on every request (measured across repeated fetches
# when the pins were set), which is the whole property this corpus is built on.
#
# The EDPB publishes its guidelines as PDF only, so the PDF is vendored as
# published (guidelines.pdf) with that fact recorded in its provenance.
#
# WHICH CELEX. An act whose amendments have been folded in is pinned at its
# CONSOLIDATED CELEX and the consolidation date; an act with no amendments is
# pinned at the authentic OJ text, because for those two the substantive text
# is the same and only the OJ version has legal effect (a consolidation carries
# EUR-Lex's own "no legal effect" disclaimer). Each act's PROVENANCE.md records
# which of the two it is and why.
#
# LICENSING. The Commission's reuse policy (Decision 2011/833/EU) covers the
# legal documents; the consolidated texts are additionally the EU's own
# editorial content under CC BY 4.0, and the EDPB states its own reuse terms.
# All three are quoted verbatim in LICENSES/, declared per directory in
# REUSE.toml, and named in each PROVENANCE.md.
#
# Idempotent: each act directory is wiped and re-fetched. Re-run after changing
# a pin below; the SHA-256 lines move with the bytes, and docs/law/README.md is
# the index that must move with them.

# EDPB Guidelines 01/2025 on pseudonymisation

The supervisory authorities' own reading of what pseudonymisation is under
GDPR Art. 4(5) and what it does to the risk analysis under Art. 32 — the
document the pseudonymisation boundary in this software is designed against.
Guidelines are not law: they bind nobody, and this record says so rather than
letting a vendored PDF read like an act.

**No text format is published.** The EDPB serves this document as PDF and
offers no HTML, XML or plain-text edition of it, so the PDF is vendored as
published. It is not converted: a converted copy would be this repository's
rendering, and a paragraph number cited against it would resolve to our
pagination rather than the EDPB's.
