# Vendor the real-world openEHR canonical-JSON corpus that grounds the
# `openehr-its` fidelity gates (read -> re-serialize -> equality +
# ITS-JSON schema validation).
#
# WHY THIS SOURCE: `ehrbase/openEHR_SDK` is the serialization library EHRbase
# itself uses, so its `canonical_json` test data is real interoperability
# ground truth rather than our own assumptions about the wire. It is prior
# art, never an oracle: where a fixture and the vendored openEHR spec text
# disagree, the spec text wins and the file is adjudicated in the ONE
# exclusion registry (`crates/openehr-its/tests/it/common.rs::excluded`), with
# a repo-authored valid twin under `crates/openehr-its/tests/fixtures/twins/`.
#
# The corpus is vendored VERBATIM and never hand-edited: to correct a fixture,
# bump the pin and re-run this script (`.claude/rules/vendored-corpora.md`).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/vendor/openehr-sdk-json.sh            # vendor at the pin below
#   SDK_PIN=<sha> scripts/vendor/openehr-sdk-json.sh
#   scripts/vendor/openehr-sdk-json.sh --check    # report drift, write nothing
