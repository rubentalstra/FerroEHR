# Vendors the German federal law the compliance pages cite into docs/law/de/,
# one directory per act, in the format its publisher serves.
#
# WHY THE TEXTS ARE IN THE TREE. Same reason as the EU and Dutch layers
# (scripts/vendor/law-eu.sh, scripts/vendor/law-nl.sh): a compliance claim
# checked against a page fetched at review time is checked against whatever
# that page says on the day. A text vendored at a named state is a fixed
# referent, and SHA256SUMS proves the bytes are the ones the script fetched.
#
# FORMAT AND SOURCE. The consolidated federal law is published by the
# Bundesministerium der Justiz and the Bundesamt für Justiz at
# gesetze-im-internet.de, which serves every act as one XML document (the
# gii-norm DTD) inside <slug>/xml.zip. The XML is vendored as the file the zip
# carries, under the publisher's own file name; the zip is a container, and
# unpacking it is not an edit of the text. The zip's own digest is recorded
# in the provenance beside the XML's.
#
# THE PIN IS THE BUILD DATE, NOT A URL. gesetze-im-internet.de has no dated
# URL: xml.zip is always the current state of the act. What the publisher does
# stamp is a builddate on the document root. Each act below is pinned at the
# builddate the vendored file carries, and this script REFUSES a fetch whose
# builddate differs from the pin, so an upstream change can never slide into
# the tree under a re-run: the pin is moved on purpose, the diff is reviewed,
# and the compliance pages are re-read against the new text.
#
# THE CONSOLIDATION IS NOT THE AUTHENTIC TEXT, and the publisher says so: the
# "Hinweise" page describes the consolidated texts as "nicht amtliche Texte".
# The authentic text is the Bundesgesetzblatt. What a compliance claim is read
# against is what the act says today, which is the consolidation; a citation
# that must be authoritative goes to the BGBl. issue. The DigiG is vendored
# from there directly, because it is an amending act: its substance lives in
# the acts it amended (SGB V above all) and gesetze-im-internet.de carries no
# consolidated text of it, so the promulgated issue on recht.bund.de is the
# only text there is.
#
# WHOLE ACTS ONLY. § 203 StGB is one section of the criminal code and the
# ePA provisions are a chapter of SGB V, but the publisher serves each act as
# one document and cutting the cited sections out of it would be an edit. The
# whole act is vendored and the provenance names the sections the pages cite.
#
# LICENCE. § 5 Abs. 1 UrhG: laws, ordinances, official decrees and notices
# enjoy no copyright protection. The paragraph is quoted verbatim in
# LICENSES/LicenseRef-UrhG-Para5-Amtliche-Werke.txt and declared for this
# subtree in REUSE.toml.
#
# OUT OF SCOPE, deliberately: the sixteen Landeskrankenhausgesetze and the
# Landesdatenschutzgesetze. A hospital reads its own state's law beside the
# federal layer here; this corpus carries federal law only, and the README
# says so.
#
# Idempotent: each act directory is wiped and re-fetched.

folded in, and of any amendment already promulgated but not yet fully worked
into the text:

| \`$xml_name\` | $xml_bytes | \`$xml_digest\` |

The XML gesetze-im-internet.de serves for this act, byte for byte, under the
publisher's own file name, unpacked from \`xml.zip\` (the zip fetched was
$zip_bytes bytes, SHA-256 \`$zip_digest\`). Nothing was converted or
extracted: an extraction is an edit, and an edited act is no longer the
publisher's text.

**This is the consolidation, not the authentic text.** gesetze-im-internet.de
describes its consolidated texts as non-official ("nicht amtliche Texte"); the
authentic text is the Bundesgesetzblatt. The consolidation is what the act
says today, which is what a compliance claim is read against; a citation that
must be authoritative goes to the BGBl. issue.

**There is no dated URL for this act.** The publisher serves only the current
state, so the pin is the \`builddate\` above and the vendor script refuses a
fetch whose build stamp differs from it. Moving the pin is a deliberate act.

# Gesetz zur Beschleunigung der Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens (Digital-Gesetz, DigiG)

The 2024 act that rewrote the ePA into an opt-out record and re-cut the
Telematikinfrastruktur provisions of SGB V. It is an **amending act**: its
substance is the new wording of **SGB V §§ 341 to 355 and 360 to 363**, which
the consolidated SGB V in \`../sgb-v/\` already carries. The issue is vendored
because it is the authentic text of those amendments, with its own entry into
force provisions (**Art. 9**: the day after promulgation, with the opt-out ePA
provisions on 15 January 2025), which no consolidation shows.

**No text format is published.** The federal promulgation platform issues the
Bundesgesetzblatt in PDF and offers no HTML or XML edition of an issue, so the
PDF is vendored as published and not converted: a converted copy would be
this repository's rendering, and a page cited against it would resolve to our
pagination rather than the publisher's. The platform answers the same bytes
on every request (measured across repeated fetches when the pin was set).

**Why there is no consolidated DigiG.** gesetze-im-internet.de consolidates
Stammgesetze, the acts that amendments are folded into. An Artikelgesetz
disappears into them: after consolidation the DigiG's text IS the current
text of SGB V and the other acts it touched. Read the ePA and TI provisions
in \`../sgb-v/\`; read this issue for what changed, when, and from which date.
