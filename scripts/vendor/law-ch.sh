# Vendors the Swiss federal law the compliance pages cite into docs/law/ch/,
# one directory per act, in the format its publisher serves.
#
# WHY THE TEXTS ARE IN THE TREE. Same reason as the EU, Dutch and German
# layers (scripts/vendor/law-{eu,nl,de}.sh): a compliance claim checked
# against a page fetched at review time is checked against whatever that page
# says on the day. A consolidation vendored at a named date is a fixed
# referent, and SHA256SUMS proves the bytes are the ones the script fetched.
#
# FORMAT AND ENDPOINT. The Federal Chancellery publishes the Classified
# Compilation on Fedlex. The web page at www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/... is a
# single-page application: it answers the same 77 kB shell for every act and
# renders the text in the browser, so it is not the fetch source. The text
# itself is served by the Fedlex filestore at
#   fedlex.data.admin.ch/filestore/fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/cc/<y>/<n>/<date>/<lang>/html/...
# one HTML document per act, consolidation and language, answering the same
# bytes on every request (measured across repeated fetches when the pins were
# set). That document is vendored verbatim as text-<lang>.html.
#
# THE PIN IS THE CONSOLIDATION DATE. Every act below names the consolidation
# in force when the pin was set (the "Stand am" the document prints); the
# undated ELI would follow Fedlex to a newer state on a re-run, which is what
# a pin exists to prevent. To find the current consolidations, the Fedlex
# SPARQL endpoint (fedlex.data.admin.ch/sparqlendpoint) lists each act's
# jolux:ConsolidationAbstract members with their jolux:dateApplicability and
# the languages each is realised in; move a pin on purpose, review the diff,
# re-read the compliance pages against the new text.
#
# LANGUAGES. German, French and Italian are the authentic languages of Swiss
# federal law; German is vendored as the reference text. Fedlex also publishes
# English translations for some acts and stamps each with "English is not an
# official language of the Swiss Confederation. This translation is provided
# for information purposes only and has no legal force." Where an English
# text exists AT THE SAME CONSOLIDATION as the German pin it is vendored
# beside it, the script asserts the disclaimer is in it, and the record says
# it binds nobody. Where English exists only at an older consolidation (the
# EPDG and EPDV: last translated years before the current state) it is NOT
# vendored — a translation of a superseded text beside the current German one
# would invite citing the wrong version — and the record names the last
# translated consolidation so a reader can fetch it knowingly.
#
# LICENCE. Art. 5 Abs. 1 lit. a URG: laws, ordinances, international treaties
# and other official enactments are not protected by copyright, and Abs. 2
# extends that to official or statutorily required collections and
# translations of them, which is what puts the Fedlex English text under the
# same identifier. Quoted verbatim in
# LICENSES/LicenseRef-URG-Art5-Nicht-Geschuetzte-Werke.txt and declared for
# this subtree in REUSE.toml.
#
# Idempotent: each act directory is wiped and re-fetched.

The HTML the Fedlex filestore serves for this consolidation and language,
byte for byte. Nothing was converted or extracted: an extraction is an edit,
and an edited act is no longer the publisher's text. The www.fedlex.admin.ch
page above renders the same document but is a single-page application that
answers an identical shell for every act, which is why it is not the fetch
source.
