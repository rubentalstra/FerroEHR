# Cut a frozen documentation version onto the docs-dist orphan branch.
# "generate once, never rebuild".
#
# Usage: scripts/site/cut-version.sh vX.Y.Z
#
# Builds the book once with site-url=/docs/vX.Y.Z/, rsyncs it into a
# docs-dist worktree under docs/vX.Y.Z/, prepends the version to versions.json,
# re-points the `latest` alias, then commits + pushes docs-dist.
#
# IDEMPOTENT (#2776): a version that is ALREADY frozen is reported and the
# script exits 0 without touching it — frozen trees are never rebuilt, and that
# is a no-op, not an error. It used to exit 1, which meant a release pipeline
# re-run after any later failure could never go green again; the recovery for
# every other leg is "re-run the pipeline", and this leg has to survive that.
#
# In a workflow the outcome is reported on $GITHUB_OUTPUT as `cut=true|false`
# (docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-commands),
# so the caller knows whether a site rebuild is needed. Nothing is written when
# the variable is unset, which is every local run.
