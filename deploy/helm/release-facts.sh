# Rewrite the chart's PER-RELEASE facts to a given application version, at
# PACKAGE time (#2779).
#
# `helm package --app-version <v>` sets the packaged chart's appVersion field and
# nothing else. Two other places in the packaged chart restate that same version,
# and both would otherwise advertise the previous release:
#
#   * the FIRST-PARTY entries of `artifacthub.io/images` in Chart.yaml — the
#     image list Artifact Hub scans, so a stale tag reports vulnerabilities for
#     software nobody is running. First-party means the images built from this
#     repository at this version: `ferroehr`, `ferroehr-viewer` and
#     `ferroehr-postgres` today. A third-party image the chart deploys —
#     `ghcr.io/rubentalstra/ferroterm` since #3305 — is a separate product on
#     its own release line, pinned in the chart's values and helpers, so
#     rewriting its tag to a FerroEHR version would publish an image reference
#     that does not exist. Its tag is left exactly as committed.
#
#     WHICH entry is which is DECLARED: each `image:` line in the annotation
#     carries a trailing `# party: first` or `# party: third` marker, and this
#     script rewrites the first kind and only the first kind.
#     scripts/checks/chart-appversion.sh reads the same marker and refuses an
#     unmarked line, so the set checked and the set rewritten are one set by
#     construction. Matching the repository NAME instead would silently
#     rewrite a future `ghcr.io/rubentalstra/ferroehr-<something>` built by
#     somebody else, and silently leave a first-party image published under
#     another name a release behind;
#   * README.md — a GENERATED file (helm-docs, from Chart.yaml + the `# --`
#     comments in values.yaml) whose install example, "This release" table,
#     attestation example and version badge all name the appVersion. Artifact Hub
#     renders it as the package's front page.
#
# The sibling artifacthub-changes.sh already injects `artifacthub.io/changes`
# rather than committing it, on the argument that a fact about a release is stale
# in the tree from the next merge onwards. This is the same argument applied to
# the two sites that were still hand-edited at every cut.
#
# It is a set of ANCHORED substitutions rather than a `yq` round-trip or a
# helm-docs re-run: Chart.yaml is ~120 lines of load-bearing commentary (the
# kubeVersion floor's KEP table, the deliberately-absent annotations) that a
# structural rewrite would re-emit, and helm-docs is a Go binary this publishing
# lane would have to install and pin to run once. Every substitution is
# counted, and the script refuses when a count does not add up, so a file that
# changed shape fails loudly instead of publishing stale facts.
#
# Usage: deploy/helm/release-facts.sh <version>
#   e.g. deploy/helm/release-facts.sh 4.0.6
# A version equal to the committed appVersion is a no-op for the README (the
# between-releases dispatch path).
