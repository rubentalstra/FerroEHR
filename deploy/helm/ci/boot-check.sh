# Boot every committed values overlay against a real ferroehr image.
#
# WHY this exists separately from deploy/helm/validate.sh: that script proves a
# render is well-formed, hardened and byte-stable, and none of those properties
# imply the server ACCEPTS what was rendered. Issue #2159 is the whole argument —
# all three overlays rendered clean, passed lint, matched their goldens, and not
# one of them produced a configuration the server would start on. The only thing
# that can tell you is the server, so this runs it.
#
# What it replays, per overlay — the complete delivery surface, not just the file:
#   * the ConfigMap's ferroehr.toml (and, when the configuration holds a secret
#     the chart cannot route, the Secret's copy instead) mounted at /etc/ferroehr;
#   * every `config.files` entry beside it;
#   * every file-shaped key of the chart's Secret, with its REAL rendered value,
#     mounted at /etc/ferroehr-secrets — an overlay's own credential fixtures are
#     the thing under test (a 15-byte HMAC secret is a boot failure, and a
#     placeholder written in its place would hide exactly that);
#   * every FERROEHR__* environment variable the Deployment declares, resolving
#     `valueFrom.secretKeyRef` against the chart's Secret.
# The one value that is synthesized is the DSN, which by design comes from a
# Secret the operator owns and this repository therefore does not carry.
#
# What it does NOT do: reach a database, an issuer, a broker or an object store.
# `config check` loads, merges and validates; it opens no socket. A live install
# is the k8s-test skill (.claude/skills/k8s-test/).
#
# Usage:
#   deploy/helm/ci/boot-check.sh                       # every deployment overlay
#   deploy/helm/ci/boot-check.sh path/to/values.yaml   # just this one
#   FERROEHR_IMAGE=ferroehr:local deploy/helm/ci/boot-check.sh
#
# FERROEHR_SKEW_UNSET is the one escape, for judging the chart against a
# RELEASED image between releases: a comma-separated list of `config.*` paths to
# unset, for keys the chart carries that the image predates. It is loud, it is
# never used by CI (which builds the image from the tree, so no key can be too
# new), and it can only REMOVE configuration — it cannot make a bad value pass.
#   FERROEHR_IMAGE=ghcr.io/rubentalstra/ferroehr:3.17.3 \
#   FERROEHR_SKEW_UNSET=config.db.migrate deploy/helm/ci/boot-check.sh
#
# Requires docker and helm. The CI lane is `chart-boot` in .github/workflows/ci.yml.
