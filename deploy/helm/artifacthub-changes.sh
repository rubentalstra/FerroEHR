# Derive the per-release Artifact Hub annotations from CHANGELOG.md, so the hub
# listing has ONE source of truth rather than a second changelog that drifts.
#
# The hub's change `kind` values — added, changed, deprecated, removed, fixed,
# security — ARE Keep a Changelog's subsection names
# (https://artifacthub.io/docs/topics/annotations/helm/), which this project
# already maintains and already guards (scripts/checks/changelog-structure.sh),
# so the mapping is one-to-one and needs no editorial decision.
#
# Usage:
#   deploy/helm/artifacthub-changes.sh <version|Unreleased>   # print the YAML
#   deploy/helm/artifacthub-changes.sh 3.17.4 --inject        # write into Chart.yaml
#
# The parsing lives in artifacthub-changes.awk beside this file.
#
# Emits `artifacthub.io/changes` and, when the section has a `### Security`
# subsection, `artifacthub.io/containsSecurityUpdates: "true"`.
#
# WHY the whole release section rather than only the chart's own entries: a chart
# version is published at a release and its `appVersion` names that release, so
# what a consumer is deciding about is the release the chart deploys. There is no
# machine-readable way to split "chart change" from "server change" in the
# changelog, and guessing from wording would silently drop entries.
