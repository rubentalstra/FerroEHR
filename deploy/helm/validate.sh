# Validate the ferroehr Helm chart:
#   1. helm lint      — default + all-features value sets (must be clean)
#   2. helm template  — render both; assert the output is valid multi-doc YAML
#   3. security gate   — assert the Kubernetes Pod Security Standards
#                        "Restricted" fields are pinned in the rendered
#                        Deployment (runAsNonRoot, seccompProfile
#                        RuntimeDefault, drop ALL caps,
#                        allowPrivilegeEscalation:false), plus our

#                        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/
#   4. golden render   — compare against deploy/helm/golden/ (or --update it),
#                        under the helm version pinned in deploy/helm/.tool-versions
#                        (`helm template` output is NOT byte-stable across helm
#                        releases, so the goldens are only reproducible on the pin)
#   5. kubeconform     — schema-validate the manifests IF kubeconform is on PATH
#                        (optional; skipped with a note when absent/offline)
#   6. values schema   — assert values.schema.json REFUSES what it claims to
#                        (typos, wrong types, bad enums, out-of-range ports) and
#                        still ACCEPTS what must stay open (the server's own
#                        config vocabulary, a parent chart's `global`)
#   7. policy postures  — assert the two sanctioned NetworkPolicy ingress
#                        postures render with the source posture each of them
#                        claims (the absent-selector refusals themselves are
#                        step 8)
#   8. template refusals — every `fail` in templates/ is probed: the values that
#                        must be refused, the message asserted, and the
#                        ENUMERATION checked both ways, so a `fail` added with
#                        no probe fails this script
#
# What it does NOT check is printed at the end of every run, and is not a
# footnote: every one of those properties has failed while this script was green
# (#2159 — all three overlays rendered, linted and matched their goldens while
# producing configurations the server refuses to start on). A green run here
# means the MANIFESTS are well-formed, hardened and unchanged. It says nothing
# about whether the deployment works.
#
# Usage:
#   deploy/helm/validate.sh            # validate (fails on lint/render/golden drift)
#   deploy/helm/validate.sh --update   # regenerate the golden renders, then validate
#
# No cluster and no network are required for steps 1–4.
# The CI gate is the `helm-golden` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml.

# (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/), so a
# change here is not a diff to review — it is an upgrade that fails on every
# existing release with an error most operators read as a chart bug. The obvious
# way to separate the viewer's pods from the server's is to add `component` to
# the shared selectorLabels helper, which is exactly the change this forbids.
#
# Pinned as an explicit expectation rather than left to the golden diff: a
# golden churns for a dozen innocent reasons and this field must never move
# quietly among them.
# Run one gate program over a rendered manifest.
#
# `yq -o=json` turns the multi-document YAML into one JSON document per line
# and `jq -s` slurps them into an array, which is the shape every gate program
# expects. A gate prints one line per violation and nothing when clean, so the
# exit status is decided here rather than repeated in each program.

# ── NetworkPolicy: the shipped ingress posture is a CHECKED claim ─────────────

# sanctioned paths must still render, AND the rendered policy must have the
# source posture claimed for it — the open default has no `from`, the narrowed
# one has one. Asserting the open default explicitly is not redundant with the
# golden: this is where the SHIPPED posture is a checked claim rather than
# whatever the template happens to emit.

# ── Every `fail` in a template is a refusal, and every refusal is PROBED ──────
# A `fail` decides something for an operator, and it ships as a string nothing
# executes: the render that would trigger it is precisely the render nobody
# runs. The egress refusal shipped a whole release guarded by nothing, which is
# not a lapse in diligence — it is the DEFAULT outcome for a branch with no
# probe, so the class is closed structurally rather than case by case.
#
# The registry below is the chart's complete refusal set — one record per `fail`
# call under templates/ — and it is checked in BOTH directions:
#
#   * every record's probe is rendered and must be REFUSED, with the message
#     naming the values an operator has to change. A refusal that fires without
#     naming its remedy is a crash with prose attached, and the message text is
#     the entire user interface of a render-time refusal.
#   * every `fail` found by grepping templates/ must have a record. This is the
#     half that stops the class from regrowing: a refusal added without a probe
#     fails this script on the commit that adds it, not a release later.
#
# The reverse direction is checked too — a record whose `fail` no longer exists
# fails as well, because a probe that can never fire is a gate reporting a
# property nothing has.

# vocabulary; typing it here would fork the config tree into the chart and refuse
# keys the server accepts. And `global:` is what a parent chart injects when this

  This script renders. It never runs the server, and never talks to a cluster.
  It therefore cannot tell you any of the following, and a green result above
  must not be read as evidence of them:

    * that the server ACCEPTS the rendered ferroehr.toml — the keys it carries,
      their types, and the semantic rules validated at boot (an auth mechanism,
      the RFC 8725 32-byte HMAC floor, a real Argon2id PHC string, the SMART
      requirements). Run: deploy/helm/ci/boot-check.sh   [CI: chart-boot]
    * that the image the chart selects UNDERSTANDS those keys. `appVersion` and
      the chart's config defaults move on different clocks, so a key added
      in-tree can be rejected by the released image.
      Run: FERROEHR_IMAGE=ghcr.io/rubentalstra/ferroehr:<tag> \
             deploy/helm/ci/boot-check.sh   [CI: the release pipeline's chart leg, on a tag]
    * that a pod STARTS, migrates the database, passes its probes and serves a
      request — config validation opens no socket. Run: the k8s-test skill
      (.claude/skills/k8s-test/) against a real cluster.
    * that the values are semantically sensible for a real deployment: that the
      issuer exists, the broker is reachable, the S3 bucket resolves, the
      NetworkPolicy egress rules actually match the peers in use.
    * anything about the CHART's behaviour under `helm upgrade`, or about
      resource sizing, scheduling or autoscaling behaviour under load.
