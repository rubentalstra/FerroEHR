|---|---|
| Version | 1.0.0 |
| Effective date | 2026-08-24 |
| Status | Active |
| Author and owner | Ruben Talstra, maintainer |
| Canonical location | `AI_STATEMENT.md` at the repository root |
| Licence | Business Source License 1.1, like the rest of the project's own text (the `openehr-*` spec crates are Apache 2.0) |
| Review | at every major or minor release, and on any trigger in §13 |

**Abstract.** This document discloses how artificial-intelligence tools are
used to develop FerroEHR, a source-available openEHR clinical data
repository. It states what the tools do and do not touch, who is
accountable, which controls bound the work and how each is enforced, the
licensing and data posture, the rules for contributors, the uses that are
prohibited, and the limitations that survive all of it. It is a
self-declaration by the maintainer, written for evaluators and regulated
adopters performing supplier due diligence, and it changes in the same pull
request that changes the practice it describes.

The key words **shall**, **should**, and **may** are used as ISO/IEC
Directives Part 2 defines them: requirement, recommendation, permission.

## 1. Scope

This document covers the use of AI tools in developing everything in this
repository: application code, the generated specification layer's
generator, tests, the conformance catalogue, infrastructure, documentation,
and this document itself.

It does not cover an AI system in the product, because there is none:
**FerroEHR ships no AI.** No model is trained, embedded, or called at
request time; no inference happens anywhere in the served software. The
optional external integrations (FHIR, AMQP, terminology servers) connect to
conventional services. AI is used to *build* the software, in the same
sense compilers and linters are used to build it.

## 2. Which frameworks apply here, and which do not

Stated plainly, because borrowed authority is worse than none:

- **The EU AI Act imposes no obligation on this project.** The Act binds
  providers and deployers of AI *systems* (Articles 2 and 3(1)); FerroEHR
  is not one. Article 50's marking duties bind the AI tool's provider, not
  the tool's user, and the European Commission's Article 50 FAQ places
  source code outside the content-marking obligation. This document is
  voluntary.
- **Medical-device regulation does not classify this project as a device.**
  Under MDCG 2019-11 Rev. 1, electronic patient record systems that store,
  transfer, and retrieve records are not qualified as medical devices. A
  downstream integrator who gives their product a medical purpose may bring
  *their* product into scope; that classification is theirs to make, and
  this document exists partly so they can answer their own supplier
  questions.
- **ISO/IEC 42001 and the NIST AI RMF are used as vocabulary, not claimed
  as conformity.** No certification is claimed, no audit has occurred, and
  the words "certified," "audited," and "validated" appear in this document
  only inside this sentence, to say they do not apply.

## 3. Terms

This document reuses the W3C AI Content Disclosure vocabulary rather than
inventing one: **none** (entirely human-authored), **ai-assisted**
(human-authored; AI edited, refined, or filled in boilerplate),
**ai-generated** (AI-generated with human prompting and review),
**autonomous** (AI-generated without meaningful human oversight). An
**agentic tool** is one that plans and executes multi-step work — editing
files, running builds and tests — under a human's direction, as opposed to
inline completion.

## 4. Accountability

One named human — the maintainer, listed in
[MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) — is the author of and accountable for
every change in this repository, whatever tool produced the bytes. A tool
**shall not** be named as an author, co-author, or signer of anything here,
because a tool cannot be responsible for accuracy, integrity, or
originality; responsibility that cannot be borne cannot be assigned. There
is no AI-issued sign-off of any kind.

## 5. Where AI is used, and at what level

The tooling is agentic AI coding assistance (currently Claude Code, by
Anthropic), operated in sessions the maintainer directs, reviews, and
merges. Levels below use the §3 vocabulary, per development activity.
Deliberately, no percentage appears anywhere in this document: no
defensible method exists for measuring one.

| Activity | Level | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Application and tooling code | ai-generated | written in directed sessions against the vendored openEHR specifications; reviewed and merged by the maintainer |
| Tests and the conformance catalogue | ai-generated | held to the same authority as the code they test: expectations cite the specification, and the attribution rules below govern failures |
| Documentation and this statement | ai-generated | held to the repository's own prose rules; the research grounding this document's structure is recorded on its tracker issue |
| Specification adjudications, owner rulings, release decisions | none | decided by the maintainer and recorded with reasoning on the issue tracker |
| Contribution and review verdicts on others' work | none | prohibited use; see §11 |

**autonomous** appears in no row, and that is the point of the next
section.

## 6. Human oversight

The maintainer directs the work, reads the result, and merges every
change; nothing lands on its own authority, and no merge is automated.
Where the tools run multi-step sessions, the session's decisions with
consequences — what a specification silence means, what a wire behaviour
must be, what ships in a release — are the maintainer's, recorded on the
tracker ([GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) § Where decisions are recorded).
A decision that exists only inside a tool session is not a decision this
project made.

## 7. Quality controls, and what each one proves

AI-produced work is not a shortcut around engineering process. Every
change, whoever or whatever wrote it, passes the same machine-enforced
gates; each control below names its enforcement, because a control without
a failing check is a wish (that principle is itself written down, in
[`.claude/rules/reliability.md`](.claude/rules/reliability.md), together
with the full enforcement register).

- **Specification authority.** The openEHR specifications are vendored
  in-repo, pinned per component, and are the only conformance oracle;
  specification-facing decisions cite file and section. Enforced by the
  conformance pipeline below and by review against the cited text.
- **Executed conformance.** A committed runner executes a machine-readable
  catalogue of roughly 1,100 cases against a freshly built server; the
  published verdicts and reports derive from committed run records, and CI
  drift gates fail when a regenerated document disagrees with a committed
  one. This is the control that catches a plausible-but-wrong
  implementation regardless of who wrote it.
- **Failure attribution.** A red conformance run is attributed by three-way
  comparison — specification-required versus catalogue-expected versus
  server-observed — and the implementation is never presumed correct
  because it was written carefully
  ([`.claude/rules/cnf-triage.md`](.claude/rules/cnf-triage.md)). Tests
  and expectations **shall not** be weakened to make a build pass.
- **Static and supply-chain gates.** No `unsafe` (compiler-`forbid`),
  deny-tier lints on panicking shortcuts, typed errors, machine-checked
  comment style, `cargo deny` policy, zizmor and CodeQL on the workflows,
  and SLSA Build L3 signed releases with SBOMs
  ([verification guide](https://ferroehr.eu/docs/latest/verifying-releases.html)).
- **A second machine opinion.** An AI reviewer runs on every pull request;
  its findings are advisory, never outrank the specifications or the
  gates, and it commits nothing
  ([`.claude/rules/ai-code-review.md`](.claude/rules/ai-code-review.md)).

What these controls do **not** prove is stated in §12.

## 8. Licensing and provenance of AI output

The project is licensed under the Business Source License 1.1. The position
taken here follows the Apache Software Foundation's and LLVM's published
reasoning rather than wishful shortcuts: an AI tool's output does not
launder anyone's copyright, the full provenance of generated text is
generally not knowable, and prompting alone is not treated as authorship. In
practice: contributions of substantially copied third-party material are
refused however they were produced; generated code is held to the same
originality expectations as human code, under the same review; and if
identifiable third-party material is found in the tree, it is removed or
licensed properly, exactly as it would be for a human-introduced copy. The
tools are used under terms that do not restrict the output's use in software
under the project's licence.

## 9. Data

No patient data, no personally identifiable health information, and no
customer data exists anywhere in this project — not in the repository, not
in test fixtures, not in telemetry, and therefore not in any prompt. Test
data is synthetic or comes from the published openEHR corpora and CKM
clinical models, which are modelling artifacts, not records about people.
This is a structural property a reader can check against the tree, not a
promise about tool behaviour. Vendor-side data handling is governed by the
tool vendor's terms; this document deliberately makes no claim on the
vendor's behalf, because such claims go stale silently. The served
software's own telemetry excludes clinical payload content by reviewed
design.

## 10. Rules for contributors

Contributors **may** use AI tools. A contribution with **ai-generated**
content per §3 **shall** say so in the pull-request description — which
tool, and what it did. Disclosure lives in the PR description and never in
commit trailers, for two reasons stated openly: this repository's standing
rule keeps tool attribution out of commit metadata (one maintained
disclosure beats ten thousand trailer lines, and this document is that
disclosure), and the wider ecosystem has no agreed trailer anyway — the
same trailers some communities recommend, others forbid. The contributor
remains responsible for their submission in full, under the same
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) bar as any other work: understood,
explained on request, tested, and honest.

## 11. Prohibited uses

In this project, AI **shall not**: merge anything; adjudicate, score, or
answer reviews of contributions (the PR reviewer of §7 is advisory input
to the maintainer, not a verdict); sign anything; decide a
specification-facing question (silences are adjudicated by the maintainer
and recorded); or weaken a test, an expectation, or a gate to make
something pass — the last being a standing hard rule for humans and tools
alike.

## 12. Limitations and residual risks

This section exists because a disclosure without one is marketing.

- **The gates prove what they test, not correctness.** The conformance
  suite demonstrates the behaviours its catalogue covers; coverage is
  broad, ratchets upward, and is itself reviewed — and it is still a
  boundary, published with the run records.
- **Review depth is one person's.** The project has a single maintainer;
  machine gates stand in for the review capacity a larger team would have
  ([GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) says this plainly). "The maintainer
  understands and can explain every merged change" is the honest claim;
  "every line was independently re-derived" would not be.
- **Retroactivity.** Commits predating this statement carry no disclosure
  markers; this document describes the practice, not a per-commit audit
  trail, and no such trail is claimed.
- **Provenance uncertainty survives.** Whether any generated fragment
  echoes unlicensed training material is not fully knowable with current
  tools; §8 states the handling, not a guarantee.
- **The legal ground is unsettled.** Copyright in AI output is an open
  question in most jurisdictions; this document records positions, and
  positions may have to change. §13 names the triggers.
- **This is a self-declaration.** No third party has audited it. The
  checkable artifacts in §7 are the counterweight: they can disagree with
  this document, and if they do, the document is wrong.

## 13. Review and change

This statement is reviewed at every major or minor release, and revised
off-cycle when any of these fires: the tooling changes materially, a tool
vendor's terms change in a way §8 or §9 relies on, a binding rule emerges
(EU AI Act guidance touching this use, a foundation policy this project
follows, a court decision on AI output and copyright), or a claim in this
document stops being true. The maintainer owns the review; the change
lands as a pull request like everything else, and the version and change
log update in the same PR.

## 14. Reporting

A suspected provenance, licensing, or quality problem in this repository —
including a claim in this document that does not survive checking — is a
report this project wants. Open an issue and cite this file; for anything
security-sensitive, use the private route in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
The handling commitment is the same as for any defect: attributed,
answered on the tracker, and never silently absorbed.
