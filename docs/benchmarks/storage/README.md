# Storage benchmark records

`app/ferroehr/benches/storage.rs` writes one record per run, at
`docs/benchmarks/storage/<schema-generation>/record.json`. It exists so a
storage change is argued from a before/after pair taken with the same
instrument, rather than from a claim: the harness drives the operations through
`FerroEhrService` and the public `ferroehr::storage` / `ferroehr::versioning`
surface and reads its database-side facts for whatever relations the catalogue
reports, so the same file measures a rewritten schema unchanged.

**A benchmark, not a conformance record.** Conformance is the CNF 2.0 suite
[Veredictum](https://github.com/rubentalstra/Veredictum) runs, and its artifacts
live under `docs/conformance/<sut>/` — including the earned performance classes.
Nothing here earns a class, nothing here belongs beside `results.json`, and this
directory sits outside `docs/conformance/` on purpose. No openEHR specification
governs storage layout or benchmarking: this is our own design.

## Running it

```bash
# the default class: a small corpus, minutes
STORAGE_BENCH_CLASS=poc cargo bench -p ferroehr --bench storage

# the larger class
STORAGE_BENCH_CLASS=s cargo bench -p ferroehr --bench storage

# CPU flamegraphs instead of timings (criterion measures nothing in this mode,
# so no record is written and an existing one is left intact)
cargo bench -p ferroehr --bench storage -- --profile-time 10
```

The database comes from the shared testkit harness (`testkit::db()`), so the
run needs the same PostgreSQL 18 container the test suite uses and nothing else.

### Header

`schema_generation` is `ext.storage_generation()` where the schema declares
one, `STORAGE_BENCH_GENERATION` where a schema does not, and `generation-1`
otherwise — it is the directory the record lands in, so two generations of the
same schema never overwrite each other. `postgres_version` is the server's own
`version()`, `measured_at_commit` the working tree's HEAD, and `cpu_count` /
`memory_bytes` the machine. A record is meaningful only with all four: the same
code measures differently on different hardware, which is the same rule the
performance classes carry.

`timings_measured` is true only when every operation in the record carries
samples. A filtered run (`cargo bench … -- storage_read`) measures some of them
and says so.

### Operations

One entry per benched operation, in four groups: `storage_commit` (a first
version, a blind supersession, and the `If-Match` supersession that states the
version it replaces), `storage_read` (by version uid, by versioned-object uid,
`version_at_time`, the revision history), `storage_query` (the CONTAINS chain
over one EHR and over the population), and `storage_lifecycle` (archive and
restore of one EHR, and one retention prune).

`iterations` is how many times the routine ran across every sample;
`mean_ns` / `median_ns` are criterion's own point estimates; the percentiles are
nearest-rank over criterion's per-sample nanoseconds-per-iteration, so a
published figure does not depend on a rounding mode.

### Database facts

`database` is attributed per operation: the counters are read immediately before
and after that benchmark, and only the relations the operation actually touched
appear. The instruments are the ones the PostgreSQL documentation names —
`pg_stat_user_tables` (`n_tup_ins`, `n_tup_upd`, `n_tup_hot_upd`, `n_tup_del`,
`n_live_tup`, `n_dead_tup`), `pg_total_relation_size`, `pg_stat_database`
(`blks_hit`, `blks_read`), and the WAL position (`pg_current_wal_lsn`,
`pg_wal_lsn_diff`). A counter read waits out the statistics flush interval
first, because a backend's pending counts reach shared memory when its
transaction ends and at most once a second; a WAL figure an unprivileged role
may not read is absent rather than zero.

`commit_probe` is one representative commit on its own: the WAL it writes and
the buffers it touches. It is measured around a real `create_composition` rather
than by `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, WAL)`, because the commit runs inside the service's
own transaction and the public API hands out no statement to explain.

`explain` is `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, WAL, FORMAT JSON)` of the population
CONTAINS statement, run inside a transaction that is rolled back, summarised to
the top node's shape, timing, buffers and the index names anywhere in its tree —
a whole plan is hundreds of lines of noise a week later.

`relations` closes the record with every relation the run put rows into: its
size, its live and dead tuple estimates, and its update-versus-HOT-update
counts. That is where the version and node relations' `pg_total_relation_size`
and bloat are read.

## What is committed

Records are gitignored by default (`.gitignore` beside this file), for the same
reason the deployment records under `docs/conformance/deployment/` are: a record
measures one machine on one day, and a directory of them invites comparison
between runs that measured different systems.

The exception is deliberate: the pre-rewrite **baseline** is committed, because
the whole point of the instrument is a before/after pair. Commit one with

```bash
git add -f docs/benchmarks/storage/<generation>/record.json
```

and say in the commit which machine it was taken on. A tracked record stays
tracked — the ignore rule only keeps the untracked ones out of `git status`.

## Where the numbers are published

Nowhere by hand. `scripts/render/storage-bench.sh` renders the committed records
into `website/book/generated/storage-bench.md`, which
`website/book/src/performance.md` includes; the stale-numbers gate
(`scripts/checks/conformance-numbers.sh`) refuses a hand-typed latency in the
site sources. With no record committed the generated page says so, rather than
carrying a number from somewhere else.
