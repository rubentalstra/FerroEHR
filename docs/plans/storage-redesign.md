# Storage redesign: the second storage generation

Tracker: #3337 (the parent; its Sub-issues panel is the canonical list of
implementation issues). This is a deep working plan under the standing
lifecycle rule: it is deleted by the pull request that lands the last of its
sub-issues (the drop of the first storage generation). Its three research
appendices live beside it in `docs/plans/storage-redesign/` and go with it.

## Evidence read

Every verdict below rests on one of three first-hand reports, each written
to disk as it was produced:

- **Report 1**, `storage-redesign/research-postgresql-18.md`: the PostgreSQL
  18 documentation (`https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/`) for every
  mechanism the current schema relies on or the target proposes, quoted, with
  the design consequence per fact and a list of twelve places where the
  repository's own comments and pages contradict the documentation or claim a
  mechanism the code does not use.
- **Report 2**, `storage-redesign/research-inventory-prior-art.md`: the
  inventory of every migration set (`ext`, `ehr`, `demographic`, `linkage`,
  `audit`, the unlanded `secondary` draft), every table, index, view,
  function, trigger, role, grant and policy, with the Rust code paths that
  write and read each relation; the node data shape; the cold tier, the
  domains, the outbox, tenancy, multimedia and the physical delete as the
  code performs them; thirty-two documented claims checked against the code;
  sixteen defects; and EHRbase 2.x's storage read in its upstream migrations
  as prior art.
- **Report 3**, `storage-redesign/research-specs-law.md`: what the openEHR
  specifications require of storage (seventy-two testable statements from RM
  common master06, RM ehr master04, RM common master03/04, BASE master05/07,
  ITS-REST 1.1.0, AQL 1.1 and the SM, with the sentences that grant
  implementation freedom quoted), and the storage-relevant provisions of the
  vendored law (`docs/law/`) as a provision × requirement matrix for the EU,
  the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland, followed by a cross-check of the
  current design and of the compliance page's claims.

Rulings that shaped the present design were re-read with their evidence:
the UNLOGGED refusal (#2698) stands; the GiST removal stands as a fact but
loses its stated rationale; schema-per-domain stays the default and gains a
per-domain connection so cluster-per-domain becomes a configuration; the
migration-immutability rule binds shipped files only (owner ruling
2026-09-15: a file is immutable once it is at the latest release tag; every
generation-2 file on `main` is in no release yet and is fixed in place, with
no rename migration, placeholder or compatibility path), and re-arms by itself
at the v4.3.1 cut. Where a claim would rest on
a number nobody has measured, this plan names the measurement (owner ruling
2026-09-13: no performance runs in v4.3.0).

## Evaluation of every in-scope component

Evidence codes: **R1** = `storage-redesign/research-postgresql-18.md`
(PostgreSQL 18 documentation, section numbers), **R2** =
`storage-redesign/research-inventory-prior-art.md` (the inventory, access
paths, claims-vs-code and defect list, plus EHRbase prior art), **R3** =
`storage-redesign/research-specs-law.md` (the openEHR specifications and the
vendored law). Verdicts: **keep** (with the reason re-affirmed), **change**
(the component survives with a different mechanism), **replace**.

| Component | Evidence read | Finding | Verdict | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `vo_version` as one temporal table with `sys_period`, four partial indexes on `upper_inf(sys_period)`, `fillfactor 90` | R1 §2.1-2.2, §3.4, §7.7, §15.1; `ehr/0001:323-513`; `commit.rs:307-330` | the close-out UPDATE modifies a column referenced by index predicates, so it is never HOT: eleven index inserts and one dead tuple per supersession; `fillfactor` cannot change that; the partial-index predicates match only because the app spells `upper_inf(sys_period)` literally | **replace** | append-only `version` + one mutable `vo_head` row per object (HOT-eligible); validity derived from `committed_at`; `fillfactor 100` on `version` |
| The removed GiST `EXCLUDE` constraints and the "inserts serialise" rationale | R1 §3.2-3.4; `ehr/0001:450-467`; `linkage/0001:107-109` | the PostgreSQL docs contain no such statement; the only doc-grounded cost fact is that equality exclusion is slower than UNIQUE; non-overlap today rests on the advisory lock, not the indexes | **replace** the rationale; the constraint stays absent because the target has no interval to protect | the advisory lock stays as the `sys_version`/412 serialiser; the miscited comment leaves with the table |
| `vo_version.body text` verbatim beside decomposed `node.data` (dual write, R2 §Defects D2) | R1 §1.5, §1.3; R3 A.7 56; R2 §Node data shape | jsonb drops key order and E-notation, and ITS-REST requires date/time literals returned as sent, so a served body cannot come from jsonb; AQL needs typed leaves and integer containment, so it cannot come from `text`. Both stores are spec-forced; the overhead is storage, not correctness | **keep**, stated as spec-forced | `version.body text COMPRESSION lz4`; `node.data jsonb`; the ratio measured (performance model H11) |
| `node`: nested set, promoted columns, ~360 B fragments, `COMPRESSION lz4` | R1 §1.1-1.2, §1.6, §7.5, §8.1; R2 §Node data shape, D1, D3, A1, A8; QUERY master03 | the decomposition and the interval join are right; `citem_num` is written on every row and read by nothing (D1); `path` is reassembly-only, not a predicate as the architecture page says (A1); lz4 on a sub-2 kB row is inert; the AQL node predicate on `name/defining_code` has no promoted column | **change** | drop `citem_num`; add `name_code`, `name_terminology`; drop the inert compression annotation; `tier` in the key; the emitter spells columns through `db/iden.rs` (D12) |
| `ext` helper functions (`openehr_magnitude`, `openehr_timestamp`, the parsers) | R1 §7.6, §9.2; R2 D3; `ext/0001` | each ends in `EXCEPTION WHEN others THEN RETURN NULL`, which opens a subtransaction on every call, and they are emitted once per candidate row per predicate; `openehr_timestamp` is STABLE (correctly, TimeZone) and so never indexable | **change** | each helper ships in whichever language MEASURED fastest with the trap kept only where the trapped native cast is the cheapest validator (`openehr_date_days`, `openehr_timestamp`): the `EXCEPTION` block costs about 0.2 µs per call, a regex guard about 0.4 µs, and folding a `LANGUAGE sql` body substitutes the caller's jsonb extraction at every parameter reference, so the premise of a uniform `sql` rewrite did not hold (PostgreSQL 18.6, 50 000 rows, #3351/#3422); five of the eight helpers fold into the statement as `LANGUAGE sql`, three stay PL/pgSQL, none is slower than the first generation |
| `cold`/`cold_demographic` mirror relations, `*_all` union views, alias views | R1 §5.8, §6, §10.4, §17 #9; R2 §The cold tier, D6, D11, A7, B2 | FK-free by construction; RLS re-declared per mirror and missing on `cold.vo_attestation`; every new `vo_version` column needs a hand-written mirror change and a view rebuild (three so far); a fresh install skips `0011` entirely; the book's "retry cold on a miss" describes a design that no longer exists | **replace** | `PARTITION BY LIST (tier)` on `version`, `node`, `vo_attestation`; archive/restore = row movement; one policy, one FK set, no views |
| `ehr`, `demographic`, `linkage` schemas selected by `search_path` on one DSN | R1 §11.1, §11.3; R3 B.3 §35-41, B.6 EPDV Art. 10 Abs. 1 lit. b, DSV Art. 4 Abs. 5; BASE master07 §Anonymity; R2 §Pseudonymisation domains, A14 | the barrier is a SQL-privilege property inside one database; a superuser, a base backup, WAL and physical replication carry every schema together; the law asks for separation that can be another machine; in dev/compose the roles do not exist, so the boot gate checks nothing (A14) | **change** | a pool and DSN per domain (co-located by default); the gate refuses missing roles under the production deployment profile; `ext` per database |
| `linkage.party_ehr` temporal map | R1 §3.1; R3 A.9 71, A.4 30; R2 §Pseudonymisation domains, D10 | the temporal PK is correctly GiST (`WITHOUT OVERLAPS`); the table is live (the architecture page's "no pool reaches it yet" is stale); a physical EHR delete leaves its mapping in force | **change** | `linkage.subject_ehr` absorbing `ehr_index`; `linkage.erase_ehr` reached by admin delete |
| `ehr.ehr_index` and the subject-proxy subject columns in the clinical schema | R3 A.9 71, C.2 7; R2 D9; SM master02 | subject identifiers sit in the clinical domain outside the pseudonym guard, reachable by the clinical role | **replace** | the cross-reference moves to `linkage`; the subject-proxy component is removed (#3431), so its relations are gone rather than re-keyed; no subject identifier remains in `clinical` other than the guarded `ehr.subject_id` |
| The pseudonym guard trigger and `posture` | `ehr/0009`; R2 §Pseudonymisation domains | validates a UUID shape once namespaces are declared; the caller mints the pseudonym; the guard covers `ehr` only | **keep**, widened | the trigger stays; the guard is the only place a subject id may sit |
| Tenancy: GUC + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` per table | R1 §5.2, §10.1-10.3; R2 §Tenancy, D6, D8, D16; the FerroHEALTH drawing (owner 2026-09-14) | correct mechanism with coverage holes, and no longer wanted: the platform achieves multi-tenancy by running one instance per organisation, so an in-database tenant axis guards nothing and costs a policy qual on every scan plus the fail-open and reader-scope defect classes (#3341, #3355) | **remove** | no `tenant_id`, policy or GUC in any set; the tenancy surface leaves the server, the chart and the book (#3378) |
| Commit path: one CTE per Contribution, server `time_committed`, advisory lock | R3 A.3 16-20; R2 A9; `commit.rs` | correct and spec-grounded | **keep** | unchanged shape; the close-out statement becomes the `vo_head` UPDATE |
| `wrapped_original`, `preceding_version_uid`, per-version `creating_system_id`, `stable_compatible`, `origins`, signature | R3 A.1-A.3; `ehr/0001` | each answers a named RM requirement | **keep** | columns on `version` |
| `contribution`, commit `audit` | R3 A.3; R2 D13 | correct; the commit-audit table's name collides with the `audit` domain and its comments contradict the later CHECKs | **keep**, renamed | `commit_audit`; the CHECKs stated in the DDL |
| `vo_attestation` | R3 A.3 23; R2 D6, D15 | append table is right; no compression | **keep** | partitioned by tier with the others |
| `item_tag`, `ehr_folder`, `template_*`, `stored_query`, `archetype_store`, `adl2_artefact`, `event_subscription`, `fhir_mapping` | R2 §Inventory, D16 | fit for purpose | **keep** | copied into `clinical`; `event_subscription` is the FerroSYS seam's question (#3382) and stays until FerroSYS carries it |
| `event_outbox` and its readers (`published_at`, `fhir_outbound_cursor`) | R1 §12; R2 §The outbox, D7, D14 | the envelope carries identifiers only (no content, no subject); the prune reads `published_at` alone and ignores every cursor reader (#3330 confirmed) | **keep**, fixed | prune floor = `min(cursor)` over registered readers, FerroBRIDGE's among them; one cursor row per reader (no tenant axis) |
| Multimedia blob GC on delete | R2 §Multimedia, D4 | a full double-domain scan with a substring match, and every node's `data` of the EHR pulled into the process | **replace** | a `blob_ref (uri, vo_id, sys_version, tier)` table maintained at commit; GC is an anti-join |
| Admin physical delete | R3 A.7 55; R2 §Admin physical delete, D10 | reaches both tiers and the outbox; leaves `linkage`, the subject-proxy rows and (correctly) the ATNA trail | **change** | the order in §Erasure reach; linkage reached, the outbox tombstoned for every consumer; the trail kept and said so |
| Restriction of processing | R3 B.1 Art. 18 + 4(3), C.2 1, C.3 | nothing at any grain; `is_queryable` limits population queries only | **add** | the `restriction` register and the head marks |
| Retention | R3 B.1 Art. 5(1)(e), 30(1)(f); B.6 DSG Art. 25(2)(d), EPDV Art. 10; C.2 3 | no datum anywhere for clinical content | **add** | `retention_policy`, `retention_anchor`, `retention_due`; the audit ceiling |
| Encryption of clinical payload | R1 §13; R3 B.1 Art. 32(1)(a), B.6 EPDV Art. 10 Abs. 1 lit. c; threat-model page | no TDE in core; pgcrypto is the documented wrong tool for a distrusted DBA; column encryption ends AQL | **keep** (no payload encryption; sealed identifiers stay) | the deployment boundary is stated per provision |
| The `secondary` domain draft (#3331) | R3 B.3 §116-120, B.1 Art. 89(1); R2 §Draft secondary domain, D14; the FerroHEALTH drawing (owner 2026-09-14) | the per-permit relationship pseudonym is the EDPB's own shape, and the platform already has the component that computes it: FerroBRIDGE loads the OMOP CDM for research in batches over AQL, so a second pseudonymised store inside the CDR would duplicate it | **remove** | no `research` domain; the CDR keeps the restriction, objection and retention marks, serves AQL over `VERSION` by `time_committed` as the batch surface and logs each population query (#3379); #3331 and #3333 closed as superseded |
| Migration sets and their order (`ext → ehr → demographic → linkage → audit`) | R2 §Schemas; the immutability rule | the order is load-bearing (the `LIKE` copies depend on it, D11) | **replace** | one DDL template rendered into `clinical/0001` and `party/0001`; each domain self-contained; the old sets deleted and an old database refused at boot (greenfield, owner 2026-09-14) |
| Documentation of the storage layer | R1 §17; R2 §Claims vs code A1-A15, B1-B9, C1-C8, P1-P9 | `JSON_TABLE`, GIN pre-filters, jsonpath item methods, `MERGE`, `RETURNING OLD/NEW`, virtual generated columns, "retry cold on a miss", "no pool reaches linkage" are described and not present; four migration comments cite measurements no committed artifact carries | **replace** the prose | corrected in the first sub-issue (D1); every future number rides a committed record |
| UNLOGGED tiers | owner ruling 2026-08-25 (#2698) | not re-opened | **keep** | every relation LOGGED |
| Migration immutability | owner rulings 2026-09-09, 2026-09-14 and 2026-09-15 | declared for installations that exist, which means files a RELEASE carries; the generation-2 files are in no release | **keep**, scoped to shipped files | `scripts/checks/migration-immutability.sh` judges against the latest release tag's tree; unreleased files are fixed in place, never papered over (#3400) |
| Schema-per-domain over cluster-per-domain | this plan | the earlier choice stays the default; the per-domain DSN makes the other a configuration | **keep**, generalised | §Domain topology |

Prior art, read for what it teaches and not as an oracle (R2 §Prior art):
EHRbase 2.x keeps per-node rows for the CURRENT version only and, since its
V25 migration, one newline-delimited text blob per past version, so history
is not queryable there; it removed multitenancy and RLS in V5; it never had a
pseudonymisation domain or an archival tier; its nested set was retrofitted
onto a materialised index string in V15; and its winning indexes are
parent-keyed and `citem_num`-keyed covering (`INCLUDE`) indexes. Two lessons
carry over: covering indexes over the nested-set join are worth measuring
(performance model, S9), and short key aliases in `data` (EHRbase's `T`, `A`,
`U`) are still rejected here because storage equals API is the property that
lets `body` serve the wire verbatim.

## What the openEHR specifications require of storage

The specifications leave the physical layout free and say so (RM common
master06 §Overview and §Versioned Objects: "any other mechanism", "not defined
by this specification, only the form of any given version is"; RM ehr
master04 §Versioning of Compositions: "how it stores successive versions in
time is an implementation concern"; BASE architecture_overview master08
§Managing Changes in Time: deltas "may or may not" be used). What they fix is
the functional interface. Each statement below is a storage invariant the
target schema carries, with the element that carries it.

| # | Requirement (citation) | Target element |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | `OBJECT_VERSION_ID` = `object_id::creating_system_id::version_tree_id`, `version_tree_id = trunk[.branch.branch_version]`, trunk from 1 by single increments, branch pairs from 1 (BASE base_types master05 §Syntaxes; RM common master06 §Local Versioning) | `version (vo_id, creating_system_id, trunk_version, branch_number, branch_version)` unique; the three tree parts are columns, never re-derived from an ordinal |
| S2 | `creating_system_id` is per version and may change along one container's trunk after a move (master06 §Distributed Versioning, §Moving Version Containers) | column on `version`, not on the container |
| S3 | `preceding_version_uid` stored; present iff not the first (RM UML `version.adoc` Preceding_version_uid_validity) | column on `version`, verbatim text |
| S4 | the container answers `latest_version` (any branch) AND `latest_trunk_version` separately, plus `version_at_time`, `has_version_at_time`, `revision_history`, `version_count` (RM UML `versioned_object.adoc`) | `vo_head (vo_id, head_sys_version, trunk_head_sys_version, latest_committed_at)`; `version.committed_at` with index `(vo_id, committed_at DESC)`; `revision_history` = a scan of `version` joined to `audit` and `vo_attestation` |
| S5 | indelible: every change including deletion is a new version; deletion = a version with Void data and lifecycle 523; incomplete (553) content may lack mandatory attributes (master06 §Contributions, §Logical Deletion, §Incomplete Content) | `version` rows are IMMUTABLE after commit (no in-place close-out); `body`/`node` nullable-shaped for 553; 523 rows have no `node` rows |
| S6 | a Contribution commits atomically or not at all, its audit copied into each version's `commit_audit`; `time_committed` is server time (master06 §Committal and Audits; ITS-REST Requests_and_responses.md) | one transaction per Contribution; `version.committed_at` = the audit's `time_committed`, stored on the version row for the at-time path |
| S7 | imported versions keep the original verbatim; time travel uses the LOCAL commit time (master06 §The Copy Operation, §Subsequent Local Modifications) | `version.wrapped_original`; `committed_at` local |
| S8 | attestations append to an existing version without a new version (master06 §Attestation) | `vo_attestation` append table; no version row change |
| S9 | `VERSION.signature` stored; canonical form not yet defined upstream (master06 §Digital Signature) | `version.signature` text, `signature_client_supplied` |
| S10 | the root EHR's `system_id`, `ehr_id`, `time_created` are immutable; `EHR_STATUS.is_queryable` gates population queries only; `is_modifiable` gates writes other than EHR_STATUS (RM ehr master04 §Root EHR Object, §EHR Status; SM `i_query_service.adoc`) | `ehr` row immutable columns; promoted `is_queryable`/`is_modifiable` on `ehr` maintained from the EHR_STATUS head; the restriction register is a separate, finer mechanism (Art. 18 is not `is_queryable`) |
| S11 | the subject↔EHR association may be "done elsewhere for security reasons"; scheme 2 puts one `PARTY_SELF.external_ref` in EHR_STATUS; the identity cross-reference database "would be easy to encrypt or protect" and can be "on different machines" (RM common master04 §PARTY_SELF; RM UML `ehr_status.adoc`; BASE master07 §Anonymity) | scheme 2 with an opaque per-EHR pseudonym; the cross-reference in `linkage`, relocatable to its own database or cluster |
| S12 | ITS-REST `ehr_get_by_subject` matches `EHR_STATUS.subject.external_ref` (`id.value`, `namespace`); one EHR per (subject id, namespace) (`ehr_get_by_subject.yaml`; `409_EHR.yaml`) | promoted `ehr.subject_id`, `ehr.subject_namespace` with the partial unique index; the pseudonym guard trigger |
| S13 | a version is addressed by `(OBJECT_VERSION_ID, path)`; nodes have no GUIDs (RM common master03 §Unique Node Identification; BASE UML `locatable_ref.adoc`) | `node (vo_id, sys_version, num)` with `path COLLATE "C"`; `LOCATABLE_REF` resolution = head or version lookup + path equality |
| S14 | AQL CONTAINS is parent/child containment; node predicates on `archetype_node_id`, `name/value`, `name/defining_code/code_string` + `terminology_id/value`; ORDER BY on Ordered types; no default order (QUERY master03) | nested set `(num, num_cap, parent_num, citem_num)`; promoted `archetype`, `name`, and NEW `name_code`, `name_terminology`; `ext.openehr_magnitude` for ordering |
| S15 | `LATEST_VERSION`/`ALL_VERSIONS` exist only in the grammar; the prose defines neither (QUERY grammar `AqlParser.g4`; master03 silent) | `LATEST_VERSION` = the trunk head (`vo_head.trunk_head_sys_version`); `ALL_VERSIONS` = every `version` row of the container; recorded as our adjudication and registered as an ambiguity with the conformance instrument, never stated as the spec's definition |
| S16 | `composition_get` by `version_at_time` distinguishes no version at t (404), a 523 version at t (204), a version at t (200) (`composition_get.yaml`, `204_deleted_at_time.yaml`) | the at-time lookup returns the version row including `lifecycle_state`; the service maps |
| S17 | the latest version uid must be cheap for `If-Match`/412, `DELETE`/409, `ETag` (Requests_and_responses.md §If-Match, §ETag) | `vo_head` row per container, one PK probe |
| S18 | date/time literals are preserved as the client sent them and returned in the original format (ITS-REST Resources.md §Datetime format) | `version.body text` verbatim for every served body; `node.data jsonb` serves AQL leaves (jsonb keeps string scalars verbatim; numbers keep their scale) |
| S19 | `admin_ehr_delete` physically deletes the EHR and everything it owns including historical versions, possibly asynchronously (`admin_ehr_delete.yaml`) | one `DELETE FROM ehr` cascades through every partition; linkage, outbox, research tombstone, multimedia follow in the same service transaction or a tracked job (202) |
| S20 | `I_ADMIN_ARCHIVE.archive_ehrs` moves EHRs "to archival storage"; no form defined (SM `i_admin_archive.adoc`) | the `tier` partition key: archive = `UPDATE ... SET tier = 'cold'`, restore = the reverse; one set of relations, FKs and RLS intact |
| S21 | `I_EHR_INDEX` is the EHR-id/subject cross-reference service (SM master02 table; `i_ehr_index.adoc`) | realised by `linkage`, not by a table in the clinical schema |
| S22 | every Party in its own version container; relationships stored in the source party; a reverse index is implied (RM demographic master02 §Versioning Semantics, §Party Relationships) | the same `version`/`node`/`vo_head` DDL in the `demographic` domain (LIKE-built), plus `party_relationship_target (target_party_id, source_vo_id)` for `reverse_relationships` |
| S23 | tags do not re-version and want an index on the key (RM ehr master04 §Tags) | `item_tag` unchanged, indexed by `(ehr_id, key)` |
| S24 | read-access logs are outside EHR content and unmodelled by openEHR (BASE master07 §Security Policy) | the `audit` domain, its own schema and DSN, never versioned |

## The target design

Five findings drive it. The version close-out UPDATE can never be HOT, so
every supersession pays eleven index inserts and leaves dead tuples behind
(research report 1 §2.1). The cold tier is an FK-free mirror that every read
path has to know about, rebuilt by hand whenever a column is added (report 1
§10.4, §17 #9). The domain barrier is a SQL-privilege property inside one
database, while the law asks for separation that can reach another machine
(report 3 B.3 §35-41, B.6 EPDV Art. 10, BASE master07 §Anonymity). Restriction
of processing and retention have no home in storage at all (report 3 C.2 1, 3).
And a second subject cross-reference sits inside the clinical schema (report 3
C.2 7). The target answers each with a structural change; everything else the
current design got right is kept and says why.

### Principles

1. **Write once.** A version row and its node rows are never updated after
   commit (BASE master07 §Integrity: "1 Version = 1 copy" is a write-once
   system). Mutable state lives in one small row per versioned object.
2. **One relation set per domain, tiers inside it.** Archival is a partition,
   never a second table. FKs and every read path see one relation.
3. **A domain is a connection, not a search path.** Each pseudonymisation
   domain has its own schema, role pair, pool and DSN (#3397). The runtime
   roles are the domain roles and nothing else (`ferroehr_clinical` and its
   reader, `ferroehr_party` and its reader, `ferroehr_linkage`, beside the
   DDL-only `ferroehr_migrator`); the first generation's names and the generic
   `ferroehr_app`/`ferroehr_reader` pair are gone, not kept as placeholders
   (owner ruling 2026-09-15, #3400). Co-located by default;
   relocatable to another database or cluster by configuration alone.
4. **The law's marks are columns.** Restriction, retention and holds are
   rows the read paths join, not documentation.
5. **Claims carry their instrument.** Every performance statement in this plan
   names the measurement that proves or refutes it; none is stated as a number.

  svc -- DSN 2 --> party
  svc -- DSN 3 --> linkage
  svc -- DSN 4 --> audit
  svc -- AQL over ITS-REST, in batches --> bridge
  svc -. never joins across .-> linkage
```

Every arrow is a separate pool with its own DSN in the configuration tree
(`[storage.clinical]`, `[storage.party]`, `[storage.linkage]`,
`[storage.audit]`), each defaulting to the same
database with the domain's schema, so the compose quickstart is unchanged and
a regulated deployment moves any domain to its own database or cluster by
editing one URL. The reciprocal role revokes and the boot gate
(`verify_domain_isolation`) stay for the co-located case; the gate additionally
refuses two domains configured on the same DSN with a shared role. No SQL
statement joins two domains; the service layer already works that way and the
per-domain pools make it impossible to regress.

`ext` (the IMMUTABLE helper functions, the posture table) is applied per
database by whichever domain migrator runs first there, so a relocated domain
carries its own copy. No openEHR spec governs schemas, roles or pools; the
EDPB guidelines' "pseudonymisation domain" (§35-41) is the concept realised.

**`version` is append-only.** It carries everything the RM fixes about a
version (S1-S3, S5-S7, S9 in the invariants table): the three tree parts,
`creating_system_id`, `preceding_version_uid`, `lifecycle_state`, the verbatim
`body text`, `wrapped_original`, the signature, the `stable_compatible` stamp,
and `committed_at` copied from the commit audit (the RM itself copies the
contribution audit into every version's `commit_audit`, master06 §Committal
and Audits). There is no `sys_period`, no partial index on a mutable
predicate, no close-out statement. Validity of version *i* is
`[committed_at_i, committed_at_{i+1})` by construction; `version_at_time(t)`
is the trunk row with the greatest `committed_at <= t`, one probe on
`(vo_id, committed_at DESC) WHERE branch_number = 0`. Uniqueness: the PK
`(tier, vo_id, sys_version)` and
`(tier, vo_id, creating_system_id, trunk_version, branch_number, branch_version)`;
the tree position `(vo_id, trunk_version) WHERE branch_number = 0` stays as a
per-partition unique index. `fillfactor` returns to 100 (report 1 §2.2: "For
a table whose entries are never updated, complete packing is the best
choice"). A BRIN index on `committed_at` serves the commit-time range
reader on the append-only heap (report 1 §7.4): AQL over `VERSION` with a
`commit_audit/time_committed` predicate, the batch surface FerroBRIDGE pages
through (#3379). `list_contributions` filters `commit_audit.time_committed`
over `contribution` and revision history is keyed by `vo_id`, so neither
reads this index; #3428 pins its plan shape over a direct range.

**`vo_head` is the one mutable row per versioned object.** It answers every
"what is current" question in one primary-key probe: the ETag for `If-Match`
and `DELETE` (S17), the latest trunk version for `LATEST_VERSION` and the
latest any-branch version for the RM's `latest_version` (S4), the lifecycle
state for the "already deleted" 400 (S16), the template for template-scoped
queries, and the two legal marks (`restricted_at`, `retention_hold_at`). Its
indexes are `PRIMARY KEY (vo_id)`, `(ehr_id, kind)` and
`(ehr_id, template_id) WHERE template_id IS NOT NULL`; the columns a commit
changes (`head_sys_version`, `trunk_head_sys_version`, `lifecycle_state`,
`committed_at`) are in no index, so the per-commit UPDATE is HOT-eligible
(report 1 §2.1). The only non-HOT updates are a template change, an archive
(tier) and the legal marks, each rare by nature. `vo_head` and `ehr` are the
two tables that keep a `fillfactor` below 100.

**The advisory lock stays.** Per-object commits serialise on
`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended(vo_id))` as today; with no
range constraint left to protect, the lock's remaining job is the
`If-Match`/412 check against `vo_head` and the monotonic `sys_version`, both
of which the head row's `UPDATE ... WHERE head_sys_version = $expected`
also enforces (zero rows updated means a concurrent commit won, the service
maps it to 412). The GiST exclusion question is therefore moot: nothing in
the target has an interval to keep non-overlapping, and the schema comment
that miscited the PostgreSQL docs (report 1 §3.3) goes with the table it
described.

**`node` keeps the decomposed nested-set model and its reasons.** JSONB has
no documented partial detoast (report 1 §1.2), so a leaf access on a whole
document pays a whole-document decompress; the per-node fragment keeps the
typical row under the 2 kB TOAST threshold (§1.1). CONTAINS as an integer
interval join over `(num, num_cap)` needs no JSON walk (QUERY master03
§Containment). `citem_num` is dropped: it is written on every row and read by nothing
(report 2 D1); EHRbase indexes on it, and if the S9 measurement shows a
path-skipping index pays, it returns with that index. Two promoted columns are added for the AQL node predicate the
spec defines and the current schema cannot serve without a JSON probe:
`name_code` and `name_terminology` from `name/defining_code` (master03 §Node
predicate). `node.data` holds the node's own attributes with structure children
removed, as today (`storage/codec.rs` `prune_children`; research report 2
§Node data shape); the verbatim
body for point reads is `version.body`, so `node.data` is never re-assembled
into a served document and its jsonb normalisation (§1.5) is harmless.
`COMPRESSION lz4` is dropped from `node.data` (inert under 2 kB, §1.1) and
kept on `version.body` and `wrapped_original` where it applies; the
cluster-level `default_toast_compression` is left to the deployment. The
promoted columns stay populated by the decomposer at write time rather than
as generated columns: VIRTUAL columns may not call user-defined functions and
STORED ones may not call the STABLE timestamp parser (§8.1), and the
decomposer already holds the parsed RM value, so the database would only
re-derive what the writer knows.

**Indexes on `node`** per partition: the PK; `(ehr_id, rm_type, archetype)`
for the per-EHR CONTAINS entry; `(rm_type, arch_entity, arch_major, arch_concept text_pattern_ops)`
for archetype-subsumption population queries; `(ehr_id, context_start) WHERE rm_type = 'COMPOSITION'`.
No GIN index: the emitter produces no GIN-servable operator (report 1 §7.5),
and adding one is a measured decision that also changes the emitter
(`@?`/`@@` with `jsonb_path_ops`). The documentation that describes
`JSON_TABLE` and GIN pre-filters is corrected in the same PR that lands the
schema (report 1 §17 #4, #5).

### Tiers as partitions

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph version[version  PARTITION BY LIST tier]
    vh[(hot)]
    vc[(cold)]
  end
  subgraph node[node  PARTITION BY LIST tier]
    nh[(hot)]
    nc[(cold)]
  end
  archive["archive_ehrs: UPDATE version SET tier='cold' WHERE ehr_id = $1"] --> vh
  vh -- "row movement" --> vc
  vc -- "FK ON UPDATE CASCADE" --> nc
  nh -. "cascade moves node rows" .-> nc
  aql["AQL: WHERE tier = 'hot'  → partition pruned"] --> vh
  aql --> nh
  point["point read: parent table, both partitions probed"] --> version
  restore["restore: the reverse UPDATE"] --> vc
```

`version`, `node` and `vo_attestation` are `PARTITION BY LIST (tier)` with
two partitions, `hot` and `cold`, and no default partition. Archiving an EHR
is `UPDATE version SET tier = 'cold' WHERE ehr_id = $1` inside a transaction
that also sets `vo_head.tier`; PostgreSQL moves the rows between partitions
(an UPDATE that changes the partition key is a delete plus insert, report 1
§5.8), and the node FK `(tier, vo_id, sys_version) REFERENCES version ON UPDATE CASCADE`
carries the node rows with it. Restore is the reverse statement. What this
buys over the mirror tables: one relation, so FKs hold across the tier (the
mirror is FK-free by construction), every read path and every future column reaches cold without a
view rebuild (the union views were rebuilt three times for exactly this,
report 1 §10.4), and AQL excludes cold by writing `tier = 'hot'`, which the
planner prunes at plan time because it is a literal. The `cold` partitions
carry fewer indexes (the PK and the FK support index only) and may sit on a
cheaper tablespace (`ALTER TABLE version_cold SET TABLESPACE`, report 1 §6);
the mirror could do neither. What it costs: the partition key is in every
unique constraint (§5.1), so the PK widens by one short column; a point read
on the parent probes both partitions' PK indexes (two probes, one empty); and
the archive statement is still a row copy, so it leaves dead tuples for
VACUUM exactly as the mirror's `DELETE ... RETURNING` did (§5.8). The per-EHR
archival unit is what the SM asks for (`I_ADMIN_ARCHIVE.archive_ehrs`), so
time-bucketed partitions that could be detached wholesale do not fit it;
the plan names that as the measured alternative if archival volume ever
dominates.

One fact to prove in the first implementation PR, as a test rather than an
assumption: that a foreign key from a partitioned `node` to a partitioned
`version` with `ON UPDATE CASCADE` performs the cross-partition row movement
on the referencing side (report 1 §5.9: the docs read neither permit nor
forbid it). If the cascade proves unsupported, the
archive statement moves `node` rows explicitly first under a deferred FK; the
design does not change.

### Demographic and linkage

The `party` domain carries the same `vo_head`/`version`/`node`/
`commit_audit`/`contribution`/`vo_attestation` DDL, generated from one
migration template so the two domains cannot drift, plus
`national_identifier` (sealed, unchanged) and a new
`party_relationship_target (target_party_id, source_vo_id)` index
table for `PARTY.reverse_relationships` (RM demographic master02 §Party
Relationships implies it). `cold_demographic` becomes the `cold` partition of
the party relations.

`linkage` holds one table, `subject_ehr`:

| column | note |
|---|---|
| `id uuid` | surrogate primary key; both real keys are partial, and PostgreSQL has no partial primary key |
| `party_id uuid` | the party's versioned-object id in `party`; no FK across the boundary. NULL on a row that records only an index association |
| `ehr_id uuid` | the EHR; no FK across the boundary |
| `subject_id text`, `subject_namespace text`, `subject_type text` | the identifier the clinical side carries in `EHR_STATUS.subject.external_ref` (the opaque pseudonym), so `I_EHR_INDEX` lookups resolve here. NULL on a row that records only a party mapping |
| `status jsonb`, `location jsonb` | `RESOURCE_STATUS` and `LOCATION_DESC` verbatim (`I_EHR_INDEX.add_ehr_subject(status, loc_desc)`); `jsonb` rather than `text` because `RESOURCE_STATUS` carries four attributes and `LOCATION_DESC` three, and flattening them would drop the validity bounds, the notes and the location the SM defines |
| `sys_period tstzrange` | `UNIQUE (party_id, sys_period WITHOUT OVERLAPS)`, kept: a merge closes a row (report 1 §3.1 confirms the GiST key). `UNIQUE` rather than `PRIMARY KEY` because the key part is nullable and because master07 §Overview forbids making the constraint total — "There is no limit on the number of subject identifiers associated with a given EHR id, and vice versa, since in real environments both situations commonly occur", and the two N:M states are exactly what the index metadata exists "to detect and rectify". A partial unique index over `(ehr_id, subject_id, subject_namespace)` among the rows in force carries the association identity beside it |

This absorbs today's `ehr.ehr_index` and the subject columns of the
subject-proxy tables: the SM names EHR Index "the EHR id / demographic subject
cross-reference service" (SM master02), and a cross-reference belongs in the
cross-reference domain, never in the clinical one. `ehr.subject_id` and
`ehr.subject_namespace` stay promoted in `clinical` because the wire binds
`ehr_get_by_subject` and the 409 to EHR_STATUS content (S12), guarded by the
pseudonym trigger; the linkage role holds the map from that pseudonym to the
party. The subject-proxy component is removed (#3431), so the clinical schema
carries none of its relations and the question of how to key them does not
arise. `linkage.erase_ehr(ehr_id)` is a `SECURITY DEFINER` function the
linkage role may execute while holding no table `DELETE`, so physical erasure
reaches the map without widening the role. `subject_ehr` is the in-instance
realisation of the SM `I_EHR_INDEX` provider; the FerroHEALTH drawing places
identity and record location in FerroPIX (IHE PIX/PIXm/PDQ/PDQm), so the
service layer reaches the map through an `EhrIndexProvider` seam that #3380
(v4.3.2) gives a second realisation, with the in-instance map as the default.

### Restriction and retention

```sql
CREATE TABLE clinical.restriction (
    id            uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuidv7(),
    ehr_id        uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES ehr (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    vo_id         uuid,                       -- NULL = the whole EHR
    ground        text NOT NULL,              -- 'gdpr-18-1-a' … a closed list
    requested_at  timestamptz NOT NULL,
    lifted_at     timestamptz,
    note          text
);
```

The register is the evidence; `vo_head.restricted_at` (and `ehr.restricted_at`
for the whole-EHR case) is the denormalised mark every read path filters on.
Restricted objects: point reads and versioned reads answer `403` with a typed
problem naming the restriction (our own extension; no ITS-REST operation
defines restriction); AQL adds `restricted_at IS NULL` to the head join;
exports and the outbox emitter skip the object, so nothing restricted
reaches FerroBRIDGE; a write to a restricted object is refused (Art. 18(2) leaves only storage).
Lifting writes `lifted_at` and clears the mark. No openEHR spec governs
restriction of processing; `is_queryable` is not it (RM ehr master04 §EHR
Status limits it to population queries).

```sql
CREATE TABLE clinical.retention_policy (
    kind          text NOT NULL,              -- COMPOSITION | EHR_STATUS | FOLDER | EHR
    jurisdiction  text NOT NULL,              -- 'NL' | 'CH' | 'DE' | …
    period        interval NOT NULL,
    anchor        text NOT NULL,              -- 'last_commit' | 'death' | 'majority'
    source        text NOT NULL,              -- the legal citation, e.g. 'BW 7:454 lid 3'
    PRIMARY KEY (kind, jurisdiction)
);
CREATE TABLE clinical.retention_anchor (
    ehr_id        uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES ehr (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    jurisdiction  text NOT NULL,
    anchored_at   timestamptz,                -- NULL until the anchor event is known
    hold_at       timestamptz,                -- EPDV Art. 10 Abs. 2 lit. b, litigation holds
    hold_ground   text
);
CREATE VIEW clinical.retention_due AS … ;     -- EHRs whose period has run, without a hold
```

The CDR never deletes clinical content on a timer: indelibility (master06
§Logical Deletion) and the national record-keeping periods both forbid it,
and the controller decides. What storage does is know the period per category
(GDPR Art. 30(1)(f), DSG Art. 25(2)(d)) and list what is due. The audit
domain gains `retention_ceiling_days` beside its floor (SGB V § 309 Abs. 3),
refused when below the floor.

### Erasure reach

`admin_ehr_delete` runs, in order and in one service transaction per domain:
(1) `DELETE FROM clinical.ehr WHERE id = $1`, cascading through `vo_head`,
`version` (both partitions), `node`, `vo_attestation`, `contribution`,
`commit_audit`, `item_tag`, `ehr_folder`, `restriction`, `retention_anchor`
and pending `event_outbox` rows; (2) `SELECT linkage.erase_ehr($1)`; (3) an
`erase` tombstone appended to the outbox before step 1 commits, which every
downstream consumer (FerroBRIDGE's OMOP load among them) applies by deleting
what it derived from that `ehr_id`; (4) multimedia blob GC as an anti-join over `blob_ref (tier, vo_id, sys_version, uri)`, maintained at every node write and carried across the tier move by its FK, so no statement scans `node` for URIs (landed, #3416; the party domain carries the same relation because the commit path is one code path over two schemas). Audit
events naming the `ehr_id` stay (report 3 B.1 Art. 17(3)(b): the logging
periods are a legal obligation), and the page says so. The delete test asserts
zero rows per relation per domain. `admin_ehr_delete_all` stays behind the
production refusal (`405`, `admin_ehr_delete_all.yaml`).

### Secondary use: FerroBRIDGE, not a research domain

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant W as clinical writer
  participant Q as ITS-REST query API (AQL over VERSION)
  participant B as FerroBRIDGE (separate product)
  participant M as OMOP CDM
  participant S as FerroSYS notifications (proposed)
  W->>W: version committed (committed_at, ehr_id, kind)
  B->>Q: AQL: versions with time_committed > last batch, restriction and objection filtered
  Q->>Q: access event (purpose, permit, rows served)
  B->>B: pseudonym per permit (EDPB 01/2025 §116-120), mapping driven
  B->>M: typed CDM rows, batch loaded
  W-->>S: erase tombstone (outbox)
  S-->>B: erasure notification, or B reconciles against the CDR
```

The FerroHEALTH drawing (owner, 2026-09-14) routes research data to the OMOP
CDM through FerroBRIDGE, a separate product that is live and in active
development: "mapping driven", "typed CDM rows", "research, batch loaded".
FerroBRIDGE loads OMOP **in batches over AQL**, and by its own design does not
consume this repository's change-event outbox (ITS-REST 1.1.0 defines no
change notification, and the platform rule is that every edge is a published
specification). The `research` domain this plan carried until 2026-09-14
(today's "secondary", #3331) would have been a second pseudonymised research
store beside FerroBRIDGE's, so it is dropped: no `research` schema, role,
pool, DSN or migration set. What only the CDR can do stays in the CDR and is
#3379's contract (v4.3.2): the restriction register (Art. 18) and the research
objection (Art. 21(6), #3325) as marks that AQL, every export and the outbox
emitter honour; the retention register (Art. 5(1)(e)); AQL over `VERSION`
with a `commit_audit/time_committed` predicate as the resumable batch surface,
served from the BRIN on `committed_at` (H7) and pinned by a plan-shape test;
and an access event per population query naming purpose and permit (EHDS
Art. 73(1)(e), Wabvpz Art. 15e). Pseudonymisation for research happens in
FerroBRIDGE, under the EDPB's relationship-pseudonym shape (§117-118) and the
trust-role separation of its Example 5; the CDR gates what leaves and records
that it left. Erasure propagation to a batch-loaded store is a platform
question the drawing leaves open: the CDR publishes the `erase` tombstone on
its outbox (our own AMQP extension), which reaches FerroBRIDGE either through
the notification service FerroSYS is proposed to carry (#3382) or through
FerroBRIDGE reconciling its EHR set against the CDR each batch; #3379 records
which, and until then the tombstone stays the only mechanism. Logical
replication stays rejected as the feed for the same reason as before: a row
filter cannot pseudonymise and column lists are "not a security boundary"
(report 1 §12.1). The outbox prune floor stays `min(cursor)` across every
registered reader (#3330).

| LOGGED tables everywhere | keep | owner ruling 2026-08-25 (#2698) |
| Schema-per-domain in one database as the DEFAULT | keep, generalised | the per-domain DSN makes cluster-per-domain a configuration, not a fork |

## Compliance mapping, article by article

Every row cites the vendored text (`docs/law/<jurisdiction>/<act>/`, article or
section) and says what the TARGET design does about it and what remains the
deployment's. Nothing in this table claims compliance; it records which storage
property serves which provision and how that property is checked. The
addressee column matters: a provision that binds a health data access body or
a certified community reaches a CDR only when the deployment is, or acts for,
that addressee.

### GDPR (`docs/law/eu/gdpr/`)

| Provision | What the text asks of storage | Target design | Deployment | Checked by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Art. 4(5) pseudonymisation | additional information "kept separately and ... subject to technical and organisational measures" | the clinical domain holds only `ehr_id` and an opaque per-EHR subject pseudonym; the party↔EHR map lives in the `linkage` domain under its own role, reachable through its own pool and DSN; the second cross-reference that sits inside the clinical schema today (`ehr.ehr_index`) moves to `linkage`, and the subject-proxy relations beside it are removed (#3431) | choosing separate databases or clusters per domain (the design supports it; the default compose is co-located) | `db::verify_domain_isolation` at boot for the co-located case; the per-domain DSN test that boots with `linkage` on a second database |
| Art. 4(3) + Art. 18 restriction | "marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing"; after restriction only storage and the named exceptions | a `restriction` register at EHR and versioned-object grain, denormalised into `vo_head.restricted_at`; every read path (point reads, versioned reads, revision history, AQL, exports, the outbox emitter) filters on it; writes to a restricted object are refused with a typed error; storage continues untouched; lifting is a second row, so the sequence is auditable (Art. 18(3)) | recording the request and informing the subject | integration tests per read path; a CNF-style wire case per ITS-REST operation for a restricted object (our own extension, no openEHR spec governs restriction) |
| Art. 5(1)(e) storage limitation, Art. 25(2) "the period of their storage", Art. 30(1)(f) | data kept in identifying form "for no longer than is necessary"; the record of processing names envisaged time limits per category | a `retention_policy` register (kind × jurisdiction → period and anchor rule) and a per-EHR `retention_anchor`; a `retention_due` view lists EHRs past their period for the controller's decision; the CDR never deletes clinical content on a timer (indelibility, master06 §Logical Deletion, and the national medical-record periods in BW 7:454 / EPDV Art. 10) | setting the periods; acting on the list | the view's tests; the book page that renders the register |
| Art. 5(1)(f), Art. 32(1)(b)-(c) | integrity, availability, "restore the availability and access ... in a timely manner" | a per-domain dump path (each domain has its own DSN, so each has its own `pg_dump`/PITR scope when separated); FK integrity across the archival tier (the tier is a partition of the same table, never an FK-free mirror) | backups, PITR, their encryption and retention | `scripts/deploy-probe.sh` restore stage (to add) |
| Art. 32(1)(a), Art. 34(3)(a) encryption | "pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data"; breach communication waived where data is "unintelligible ... such as encryption" | national identifiers stay sealed (AES-256-GCM, keyed HMAC lookup, one key per instance) in `demographic`; clinical payload is NOT encrypted inside PostgreSQL: there is no transparent data encryption in PostgreSQL 18 and column encryption of `node.data` would end AQL (the docs-verified reason on the threat-model page). Re-affirmed. | disk or volume encryption, TLS, key custody | the threat-model page names the boundary; the k8s probe reads the storage class encryption flag (to add) |
| Art. 17 erasure | "erase personal data without undue delay"; ITS-REST `admin_ehr_delete`: physically delete the EHR "and their historical versions ... in compliance with applicable data protection regulations" | physical delete reaches: every tier (one partitioned table, so one DELETE); `linkage` rows for the EHR through `linkage.erase_ehr(ehr_id)`, a `SECURITY DEFINER` function the linkage role may execute while holding no table `DELETE`; pending outbox rows; a tombstone event so every downstream consumer (FerroBRIDGE's OMOP load among them) drops what it derived from the EHR; multimedia blobs. Audit events naming the `ehr_id` are KEPT: the logging periods (NL 5 years, CH 1 year, DE § 309 3 years) are the Art. 17(3)(b) legal obligation, and the `ehr_id` maps to nothing once the EHR is gone | backup rotation (the erasure completes when the last backup holding the EHR expires; the page states the window) | the `delete_ehr` integration test asserts zero rows per table per domain, including linkage and outbox |
| Art. 11 | the controller need not hold identifiers merely to comply | the clinical domain holds none; subject-rights requests resolve through `linkage` | | the domain-isolation boot gate |
| Art. 25(1)-(2) | pseudonymisation from design time; by default not accessible without the individual's intervention | the domains and the pseudonym guard (the DB trigger that refuses a non-UUID subject id once namespaces are declared). The two defaults that favour compatibility are no longer silent (#3323, shipped): under `deployment_profile = "production"` an `open` `authz.rbac.ehr_access_default` and an `open` `audit.fail_mode` each stop the boot as a named gap (`open_ehr_access_default`, `audit_fails_open`) unless the deployment closes it or accepts it by name in `deployment_accepts`, and what it accepted is stated at every boot and on `/rest/status`. The shipped defaults themselves are unchanged | declaring `privacy.subject_namespaces`; choosing the restrictive settings or recording the acceptance | trigger tests; the deployment-posture tests |
| Art. 89(1) research safeguards | pseudonymisation where the purpose allows; anonymisation where it suffices | pseudonymisation for research happens in FerroBRIDGE on its way to the OMOP CDM (EDPB §117-118 relationship pseudonyms per permit, the trust-role separation of Example 5); the CDR gates what leaves: AQL over `VERSION`, the exports and the outbox emitter honour the restriction register and the research objection (#3325), carry no identifier beyond `ehr_id`, and every population query emits an access event naming purpose and permit (#3379) | issuing permits; operating FerroBRIDGE and the data access body role | the AQL integration tests (filtered rows absent, no subject identifier in the result set); the access-event test |

### EDPB Guidelines 01/2025 (`docs/law/eu/edpb-guidelines-01-2025-pseudonymisation/`)

§35-41 (the pseudonymisation domain): each PostgreSQL role plus the pool that holds it IS a domain in the guidelines' sense; the reciprocal revokes keep additional information out of the clinical domain. §88-91 (the permit pseudonym, a keyed one-way function over `ehr_id` under a per-permit secret) is FerroBRIDGE's to realise; the CDR's contribution is that the query surface hands it nothing but `ehr_id` and clinical content. §116-120: the clinical domain's `ehr_id` is a record identifier the RM itself mandates (it is not a person pseudonym: one subject may hold several EHRs and the RM keeps `ehr_id` "distinct from any identifier for the subject of care"); FerroBRIDGE derives relationship pseudonyms per permit from it and no person pseudonym.

## Platform alignment: the FerroHEALTH drawing

The owner's architecture drawing (2026-09-14) places FerroEHR inside a
**FerroHEALTH instance** beside sibling products and proposed platform
services: FerroTERM (terminology), FerroBRIDGE (FHIR R4 facade and the
OMOP CDM load, live), FerroCHART (template to form), and, proposed, FerroPIX
(master patient index, IHE PIX/PIXm/PDQ/PDQm), FerroSMART (OAuth 2.0, OIDC,
SMART authorisation server), FerroSYS (health, telemetry, event log,
notification subscriptions, install and deploy) and FerroFED (XCPD patient
discovery, distributed AQL). Veredictum stays the external acceptance
instrument. Two statements on the drawing bind this plan and are absorbed by
the rewrite rather than deferred, because both remove structure and removing
it later would be a second rewrite:

| Drawing statement | Consequence for the rewrite | Where |
|---|---|---|
| "Multi-tenancy is achieved by running separate instances" | no in-database tenancy: no `tenant_id`, no row policy for tenancy, no GUC, no tenant registry, no per-tenant reader cursors, no tenancy posture; isolation between organisations is a deployment property (one instance, one database, one set of domain roles), stronger than a row policy and free of the fail-open and reader-scope defect classes tenancy carried (#3341, #3355) | #3378 (v4.3.1); §Migration set layout; the evaluation table |
| research data reaches the OMOP CDM through FerroBRIDGE, "batch loaded" over AQL | no `research` domain in the CDR; the CDR keeps the outbox, the restriction, objection and retention marks, and makes AQL over `VERSION` by `time_committed` the resumable batch surface; pseudonymisation for research is FerroBRIDGE's | #3379 (v4.3.2); §Secondary use |

The other seams the drawing shows are contracts FerroEHR exposes, filed under
the v4.3.2 program #3377 and specified by the open standard each realises,
never by a sibling's internals; every seam keeps a local default so nothing in
FerroEHR depends on a sibling being present: FerroPIX as an `I_EHR_INDEX`
provider behind an `EhrIndexProvider` seam (ITI-83, ITI-78; #3380), FerroSMART
as RFC 7662 introspection beside JWT validation plus SMART launch context as
ABAC attributes (#3381), the FerroSYS seam over the operator surfaces (#3382),
and the federation node contract for FerroFED over ITS-REST (#3383). Each
platform service is its own product in its own repository (owner, 2026-09-14:
FerroFED gets one, like FerroTERM, FerroBRIDGE and FerroCHART), so nothing of a
gateway, an authorisation server, an MPI or a control plane is built here;
#3383 reads the openEHR Federation Working Group's "Proposal for Federation
Tier with AQL" (v0.9.0 release candidate, CC0) and its Apache-2.0 reference
gateway as input for the node contract, never as a specification. The
pseudonymisation domains and their role barriers are unrelated to tenancy and
stay as §Domain topology draws them: they are the defence in depth a
single-tenant instance keeps. Row-level security is not kept as a second layer
under the instance boundary (the accompanying note suggests leaving it on): with
one tenant the policy is a constant-true predicate that costs a qual on every
scan and keeps the fail-open class of defect (#3341) alive for no isolation
gained. Two further consequences of the drawing are recorded rather than
decided here. The FHIR R4 facade is FerroBRIDGE's ("holds no data of its own
and translates on demand"), so the FHIR conversion core and outbound feed this
repository ships in `ferroehr-ext` behind the `fhir` feature, with the
`fhir_mapping` relation and the `fhir_outbound` reader, overlap with a
sibling; the in-tree connector retires in FerroBRIDGE's favour (owner ruling
2026-09-03, #3080, now v4.3.2 under #3377; the terminology client and the
ATNA rendering stay), and the `clinical` set's `0009_integrations` file
carries `fhir_mapping` until that lands. And a
record moved between federation nodes must keep its `OBJECT_VERSION_ID` with
its `creating_system_id` intact (RM common master06 §Moving Version
Containers), which the EHR_EXTRACT surface this repository already serves
(`/message`) is the standard for; #3383 carries that constraint, and reads the
Syntaric "Federation Tier with AQL" proposal (0.9.0, 2026-09-13, CC0) as prior
art for the node contract: a gateway resolves the patient outside AQL (IHE
PIXm or a record locator) and dispatches standard `ehr_id`-scoped AQL to each
node, so no directly identifying identifier survives into the dispatched
query, consent is enforced at each node before it releases data, and rows
carry endpoint provenance. No openEHR spec governs the platform split; the
SM's component map is what the seams are named after.

## Cutover: a greenfield rewrite

Owner ruling 2026-09-14: this is a greenfield rewrite. No organisation runs
FerroEHR in production, so no database has to survive the change, and the
target carries no second generation beside the first. Greenfield is the
cleaner and the faster path: one relation set, one code path, no copy tool,
no generation stamp, no legacy branch in the readers, and a migration set a
reader can navigate file by file.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> New: the release ships one migration set per domain, one concern per file
  New --> Serving: a fresh database migrates and serves
  Old --> Refused: a database from an earlier release is refused at boot
  Refused --> New: the operator recreates the database
```

### What the release does

1. **One migration set per domain, in natural files.** The `ext`, `clinical`,
   `party` (rendered from the same DDL template as clinical), `linkage`
   and `audit` sets are re-authored as sequences of files, one
   concern each (§Migration set layout below), never one squashed baseline.
   The `ehr`, `demographic` and the present `linkage` and `audit` sets are
   deleted in the same pull request; the schema names change with the
   domains (`clinical`, `party`).
2. **The boot sequence refuses an old database.** A database whose
   `_sqlx_migrations` record names files the binary no longer carries is
   refused with a message saying it predates the storage rewrite and must be
   recreated; nothing is upgraded in place, nothing is copied.
3. **The immutability rule binds shipped files only.** A migration is
   immutable once it is at the latest release tag (v4.3.0 today); the
   generation-2 files are in no release, have been applied by no
   installation, and are fixed in the file that defines them whenever their
   content is wrong or moves (owner ruling 2026-09-15: the rewrite is
   breaking changes only; no rename migration, placeholder role or
   compatibility path). `scripts/checks/migration-immutability.sh` judges a
   pull request against the release tag's tree and re-arms by itself at the
   v4.3.1 cut, with no escape hatch (#3400).
4. **Everything that seeds a database starts from the new baselines**: the
   testkit template, the compose quickstart, the Helm chart's boot, the
   hosted sandbox's reseed, the conformance pipeline's fresh volumes.
5. **The tenancy surface leaves with the old sets** (#3378). No `tenant_id`
   column, no `tenant_isolation` policy, no `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` for
   tenancy, no `ferroehr.tenant_id` GUC, no `tenant` registry, no per-tenant
   reader cursors, no tenancy posture; and with them `[tenancy]` in the
   configuration tree, the tenant middleware, the `/admin/tenant` routes, the
   Helm and compose tenancy keys, the book's tenancy pages and every tenancy
   test. A catalog test asserts no relation in any domain carries a
   `tenant_id` column and no row policy exists.

### Migration set layout: natural files, one concern each

Owner direction 2026-09-14: not one squashed baseline per domain. Each domain's
set is a sequence of files (`sqlx migrate add --sequential`), one concern per
file, named by the concern, so a reader finds the change-control tables in the
file called change control and the grants in the file called grants. The party set is rendered from the same template as the clinical
one and carries the same file names where the concern is shared. From the
merge that lands them, these files are the immutable ones (a later change is
a new file, as the rule says).

| Domain | Files, in order |
|---|---|
| `ext` | `0001_schema_and_roles` (schema, the six runtime roles guarded by existence: `ferroehr_migrator`, `ferroehr_clinical`, `ferroehr_clinical_reader`, `ferroehr_party`, `ferroehr_party_reader`, `ferroehr_linkage`; default privileges) · `0002_openehr_functions` (the `IMMUTABLE`/`STABLE` helpers, each in the form that measured fastest) · `0003_posture` (`posture`, `stamp_posture`) · `0004_grants` |
| `clinical` | `0001_schema_and_grants_baseline` (schema, search-path notes, the barrier revokes) · `0002_ehr` (`ehr`, the subject pseudonym guard) · `0003_change_control` (`commit_audit`, `contribution`, `version` partitioned by tier, `vo_head`, `vo_attestation`) · `0004_node` (the nested-set table partitioned by tier, its indexes) · `0005_folders_and_tags` (`ehr_folder`, `item_tag`) · `0006_definitions` (`template_ref`, `template_store`, `archetype_store`, `adl2_artefact`, `stored_query`) · `0007_restriction_and_retention` (`restriction`, `retention_policy`, `retention_anchor`, the `retention_due` view) · `0008_outbox` (`event_outbox`, `event_outbox_reader`, `event_subscription`) · `0009_integrations` (`fhir_mapping`, `blob_ref`) · `0010_grants` (per-role grants over the finished relations) |
| `party` | `0001_schema_and_grants_baseline` · `0002_change_control` · `0003_node` · `0004_identifiers` (`identifier_scheme`, `national_identifier`, the sealed-value resolver) · `0005_relationships_and_tags` (`party_relationship_target`, `item_tag`) · `0006_outbox` · `0007_integrations` (`blob_ref`) · `0008_grants` |
| `linkage` | `0001_schema_and_role` · `0002_subject_ehr` (the temporal map) · `0003_erase_ehr` (the definer function) · `0004_grants` |
| `audit` | `0001_schema_and_roles` · `0002_audit_event` · `0003_tamper_chain` (the hash chain, its triggers and functions) · `0004_access_fields` (domain, purpose, legal basis, organisation, roles, origins) · `0005_retention` (floor and ceiling readers) · `0006_grants` |

Two rules keep the layout honest: a file carries the tables of one concern
and the indexes and comments that belong to them, never a grant — every grant
of a domain sits in the file named for grants, which is the LAST file of its set
(`ext/0004`, `clinical/0010`, `party/0008`, `linkage/0004`, `audit/0006`), so
the catalog sweep and the boot gate have one file to read per domain; and the
numbering is per domain with no gaps, so `_sqlx_migrations` reads as the table
of contents.

### What breaks, and how a deployment is told

| Change | Who sees it | Where it is said |
|---|---|---|
| A database from an earlier release is refused | anyone who kept one | `CHANGELOG.md` `### Changed` with a **BREAKING** lead; the release notes; the boot refusal message itself; the book's upgrade page ("recreate the database") |
| Four DSNs instead of one (defaulting to the old one) | operators editing `ferroehr.toml` or Helm values | `config-*.md` pages; the Helm chart's `database.*` values gain per-domain overrides; `config check` reports the layout |
| Backup procedure per domain | operators | `operations.md` §Backup: four dumps or one, by DSN layout; the k8s probe gains a restore stage |
| Schema names `clinical` and `party` | anyone reading the database directly | the storage page; the DPIA |
| `LATEST_VERSION` semantics unchanged; `ALL_VERSIONS` now includes branch rows explicitly | AQL authors | the AQL page; a CNF-style case pins it |
| Restricted objects answer `403` | API clients | the REST pages; the compliance page's Art. 18 row |
| `admin_ehr_delete` reaches linkage and tombstones the outbox | operators | the admin page; the DPIA |
| No in-database multi-tenancy: `[tenancy]`, the tenant routes and the tenant GUC are gone | operators of a multi-tenant deployment (none in production) | `CHANGELOG.md` `### Removed`: multi-tenancy is achieved by running separate instances; the book's deployment page (#3378) |
| No `research` domain; secondary use leaves through FerroBRIDGE over AQL | nobody yet (unshipped; #3331 closed) | #3379; the compliance page's Art. 89(1) and EHDS rows |

### Spec-profile and conformance

The `stable_compatible` stamp and the assembly gate move unchanged onto
`version`. The CNF baseline is re-run on the new schema before the release
(`scripts/conformance.sh`), on fresh volumes as always.

## The performance model

No measurement runs in v4.3.0 (owner ruling 2026-09-13). Every expected
improvement below is a hypothesis with the instrument that decides it; none
is a number, and the first implementation PR of each sub-issue carries the
measurement as its acceptance criterion where the class allows. Instruments
are the ones the PostgreSQL docs name (research report 1 §15.2): `EXPLAIN
(ANALYZE, BUFFERS, WAL)` inside a rolled-back transaction,
`pg_stat_user_tables`, `pg_stat_statements` (already preloaded in the
compose stack), and the conformance instrument's `perf` classes and
`aql-probe` for the wire-level view.

| # | Hypothesis | Mechanism (doc-grounded) | Measurement | Class / instrument |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Commit latency and write amplification fall | the supersession no longer inserts into eleven indexes and no longer leaves a dead `vo_version` tuple (report 1 §2.1); the `vo_head` UPDATE is HOT | `pg_stat_user_tables.n_tup_upd` vs `n_tup_hot_upd` on `vo_head` (expect the ratio near 1) and `n_dead_tup` on `version` (expect near 0) after a seeded run; `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, WAL)` WAL bytes per commit before vs after | `veredictum perf` class S write mix; `aql-probe` statement attribution |
| H2 | Bloat and VACUUM pressure on the version store fall | `version` is append-only; autovacuum rides the insert threshold instead of the 20% update scale factor (report 1 §15.1) | `pgstattuple` dead-tuple percentage on `version` vs today's `vo_version` after the same seed; autovacuum run count | the harness's `s` class; class L on the wire side is Veredictum's seed |
| H3 | Current-version probes get cheaper and stay cheap | one PK probe on `vo_head` replaces a partial-index probe whose predicate calls `upper_inf` (report 1 §7.7); index-only scans on `version` stop degrading because pages become all-visible once (§7.2) | `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` shared-hit counts for `composition_get` latest and `If-Match` paths | `aql-probe` |
| H4 | Population AQL over a store with an archive is unaffected by the archive's size | `tier = 'hot'` is a literal, pruned at plan time (report 1 §5.2); the mirror design already excluded cold, so the claim is parity, not gain | `EXPLAIN` shows one partition; latency equal within noise to a store with no cold rows | class L with a 30% archived seed |
| H5 | Point reads on the partitioned parent cost one extra empty probe | two partition PK indexes are probed (report 1 §5.1 corollary) | `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` on `version_get_by_id`: expect one additional index probe with zero heap fetches | `aql-probe`; acceptance is "no p99 regression" on class S |
| H6 | Archive and restore are no slower than the mirror copy | both are row copies (report 1 §5.8); the target drops the view layer and FK-free mirror, not the copy | rows per second archived on a class L seed, before vs after | admin archive timing in the deploy probe |
| H7 | The commit-time range reader serves from BRIN | `committed_at` is physically correlated on an append-only heap (report 1 §7.4); the reader is AQL over `VERSION` by `commit_audit/time_committed` (#3379); `idx_version_hot_committed_brin` has no other caller | `EXPLAIN` shows a Bitmap Heap Scan on the BRIN index for that predicate (pinned over a direct range by #3428) | `aql-probe` |
| H8 | The node write path is unchanged | rows are inserted through `unnest` arrays as today; two promoted columns are added | `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, WAL)` per composition commit: WAL bytes within a few percent of today | class S |
| H9 | The single-tenant schema pays no policy qual on any scan | no `tenant_isolation` policy exists, so no policy qual or InitPlan is attached (report 1 §10.2 describes the cost that is gone) | `EXPLAIN` of every hot path shows no policy qual; the baseline's tenant-scoped plans are the comparison | `aql-probe` |
| H10 | The per-domain pools add no latency in the co-located default | four pools to one database; connection counts are configured per pool | `pg_stat_activity` connection count under class S; p99 unchanged | class S |
| H11 | The dual write (`body` + `node`) costs storage, not latency | both are spec-forced (evaluation table); the ratio is a fact to record, not a claim | `pg_total_relation_size` of `version` vs `node` on a seeded corpus; point-read latency of `body` vs a reassembly from `node` | class S seed; `aql-probe` |

Two alternatives the plan names for measurement rather than adopting:

- **Hash partitioning of `version`/`node` on `vo_id`** (the only key-compatible
  scheme, report 1 §5.1): pays off only if per-partition VACUUM or parallel
  append on population queries is shown to matter at class L/R; costs planner
  memory per session (§5.4) and partitionwise-join tuning (§5.3).
- **Time-bucketed `cold` partitions** detached wholesale (§5.8): pays off only
  if archival volume dominates and the archive unit can be a time range
  rather than an EHR.

Both are decided by the after-rewrite comparison (#3350) over the harness's own classes (`STORAGE_BENCH_CLASS`) and, on the wire side, the corpus Veredictum seeds by class; no in-repo corpus generator exists (#3332 closed as not planned, owner 2026-09-16: it duplicated Veredictum's seeding).

### The measurement program

Owner direction 2026-09-14: the rewrite is shown faster or more optimised,
never asserted. The program is filed as sub-issues of #3337 and sequenced so a
comparison exists before the rewrite lands:

| Issue | What it delivers | Sequencing |
|---|---|---|
| #3367 | the storage benchmark harness (`benches/storage.rs`, criterion over a testkit database): commit and supersession, point reads, `version_at_time`, revision history, `If-Match`, AQL CONTAINS over one EHR and the population, archive, restore, prune; database-side facts (`n_tup_hot_upd`, `n_dead_tup`, WAL bytes, buffer hits) beside wall-clock; a comparable JSON record under `docs/benchmarks/storage/<generation>/` | first |
| #3368 | the pre-rewrite baseline: the harness record for the current schema, committed (closed 2026-09-15); the wire-level side moved to #3350 by owner ruling of 2026-09-15 (no measured conformance runs during the rewrite; the published 4.3.0 image is the before side) | blocks #3342 |
| #3369 | plan-shape tests: `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` in a rolled-back transaction pins the node type, index and partition of every hot path, in the ordinary test battery | after #3342 |
| #3350 | the after-rewrite comparison: H1-H11 against the baseline, no hot path slower beyond the stated tolerance, the partitioning and GIN alternatives decided; plus the wire-level before/after (`veredictum perf` class POC and `aql-probe`, the 4.3.0 image against the rewritten build, in one session at the end; class S is not measurable on this box) | after #3342, #3367, #3368 |
| #3370 | a dispatch-only lane that repeats the comparison against the committed record with a stated tolerance; exploration, never a conformance record | after #3367 |

Every number that reaches a page comes through a generated include over a
committed record; the stale-numbers gate refuses a hand-typed one.

## Decomposition into implementation issues

Each item below is filed as a sub-issue of #3337 (the Sub-issues panel is
the canonical list; this table is the plan's working view and is deleted
with the plan). Owner ruling 2026-09-14: the sub-issues and every issue
blocked on them sit in **v4.3.1**, the next patch milestone. There is no v5.x
milestone to send anything to: v5 is withdrawn (owner 2026-09-16), and the
lean application layer that was to carry it — #3086's ruling that the SM is a
call-semantics reference rather than the structure of `ferroehr::service`,
whose module split follows the storage domains instead — is **v4.3.2**, with
#3087, #3088, #3089, #3105, #2236 and #3085 under it. Two exceptions ride the
current milestone under the fix-first rule: the documentation corrections (D1)
and the tenant reader (D2). Sequencing is expressed as native `blocked-by`
edges, set with `scripts/gh/rel.sh`.

| Key | Issue | Milestone | Blocked by | Acceptance (summary; the issue carries the full list) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 (#3340) | docs(storage): the storage pages and migration comments describe `JSON_TABLE`, GIN pre-filters and a GiST serialisation the code and the PostgreSQL docs do not carry | v4.3.0 | | every claim in research report 1 §17 #1, #4, #5, #6, #7 is corrected or removed in `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/postgres-features.md`, `website/book/src/concepts/storage.md`, `.claude/rules/aql-engine.md`, `CLAUDE.md`; migration comments are left as shipped (immutability) and the corrections name them |
| S1 (#3342) | feat(storage): the clinical schema rewritten: append-only `version`, `vo_head`, tier-partitioned `version`/`node`/`vo_attestation`, `name_code`/`name_terminology` | v4.3.1 | D1 | the `clinical` set as natural files from a DDL template (§Migration set layout), the `ehr` set deleted, an old database refused at boot, the immutability guard re-declared; write path with the HOT head update and no close-out; every read path (point, at-time, by-id, revision history, directory at time, AQL LATEST_VERSION/ALL_VERSIONS, exports, dump) on the new relations; the FK-cascade row-movement proof as a test; no tenant column, policy or GUC in any set (#3378); `stable_compatible` gate moved; CNF baseline green on gen-2 |
| S2 (#3343) | feat(config): one pool and DSN per pseudonymisation domain | v4.3.1 | | `[storage.<domain>]` with `url`/`url_file` per domain defaulting to the shared DSN; four pools; `verify_domain_isolation` extended to refuse a shared role across DSNs and to refuse MISSING roles under the production deployment profile (today a missing role is skipped, so dev and compose enforce nothing); Helm `database.<domain>.*`; compose unchanged by default; `config check` reports the layout; book pages |
| S3 (#3344) | feat(storage): the party domain on the generation-2 template, `party_relationship_target`, cold as a partition | v4.3.1 | S1 | `party/0001_baseline.sql` generated from the same template as clinical (a test proves the two differ only in the CHECK that refuses the other's kinds); `reverse_relationships` served from the index table; `cold_demographic` retired |
| S4 (#3345) | feat(linkage): `subject_ehr` absorbs `ehr_index`, the subject-proxy component is removed (#3431); `erase_ehr` | v4.3.1 | S2 | the SM `I_EHR_INDEX` calls served from linkage through the linkage pool; no subject identifier column remains in `clinical` other than the guarded `ehr.subject_id`; `linkage.erase_ehr` executable by the linkage role without table `DELETE`; the boot gate covers the new function |
| S5 (#3346) | feat(storage): retention register, anchors, holds and the `retention_due` view; the audit retention ceiling | v4.3.1 | S1 | the three relations; the view; `retention_ceiling_days` per jurisdiction refused below the floor; the book's retention page renders the register; DSG Art. 25(2)(d) answer path |
| S6 (#3347) | feat(admin): physical erasure reaches linkage and tombstones the outbox for every consumer; the blob GC becomes an anti-join over `blob_ref` | v4.3.1 | S1, S4 | `delete_ehr` order as the plan states; the tombstone published on the outbox; `blob_ref` maintained at commit, GC no longer scans `node`; test asserts zero rows per relation per domain; the compliance page's Art. 17 row rewritten and the audit-retention exception stated |
| S10 (#3351) | feat(ext): each helper function in the form that measured fastest; the emitter spells every column through `db/iden.rs` | v4.3.1 | | `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE)` shows the folded helpers inlined; a test proves identical results over the parser corpus; no helper measures slower than the first generation, and an `EXCEPTION` block remains only where the measurement shows the trapped cast is the cheapest validator, with that measurement in the helper's comment; `citem_num` and the unused `Iden` definitions gone |
| D2 (#3341) | fix(tenancy): `ext.current_tenant_id()` resolves an unset GUC to the default tenant instead of refusing | v4.3.0 | | under a multi-tenant posture an unset `ferroehr.tenant_id` raises; single-tenant deployments keep the default; a test covers both |
| S11 (#3378) | feat(storage): the instance is single-tenant: the rewrite carries no in-database multi-tenancy, and the tenancy surface leaves the server, the chart and the book | v4.3.1 | S1 | a catalog test asserts no `tenant_id` column and no row policy in any domain; `[tenancy]`, the middleware, the routes, the chart and compose keys, the book pages and the tenancy tests are gone; `CHANGELOG.md` `### Removed` says multi-tenancy is achieved by running separate instances |
| S9 (#3350) | perf(storage): the after-rewrite comparison against the pre-rewrite baseline; the alternatives decided (the measurement program: #3367, #3368, #3369, #3370, §The measurement program) | v4.3.1 | S1, #3367, #3368, #3332 | every hypothesis in the performance model has a committed measurement record; each of the three alternatives has a decision with the record cited |
| S12 (#3391) | test(storage): the storage spike test builds a first-generation `vo_version` of its own; rewrite it against generation 2 or delete it | v4.3.1 | S1 | landed: no test builds a schema of its own beside the migration sets |
| S13 (#3398) | fix(config): the deployment posture ignores the audit pool — `SharedCluster` reads three domains and `MigrateOnRuntimeCredential` tests only `[db].migrate_url` | v4.3.1 | S2 | landed: the posture reads all four databases, and a domain prepared on its own runtime credential is a named gap |
| S14 (#3399) | chore(deploy): a fourth backup CronJob for the audit domain when it has a DSN of its own | v4.3.1 | S2 | `backup.audit` renders only when `database.audit` names its own secret, with its own claim and credential; the clinical dump then stops naming the `audit` schema; goldens, chart README and the install notes follow |

Existing issues re-pointed rather than duplicated:

- **#3324** (Art. 18 restriction finer than the EHR) stays a child of the GDPR
  audit #3322 and gains `blocked-by S1`; its contract is amended to the
  `restriction` register and the `vo_head.restricted_at` mark of this plan.
- **#3331** (the secondary-use domain) and **#3333** (its book page) are
  closed as superseded: secondary use leaves through FerroBRIDGE to the OMOP
  CDM (§Secondary use), and the CDR side is #3379 in v4.3.2. **#3332**
  (synthgen) is closed as not planned (owner 2026-09-16): it duplicated the
  corpus Veredictum seeds by class, and the harness seeds itself.
  **#3160** (their parent) is closed as superseded by #3379. **#3325** (the
  research objection) stays in v4.3.1 as a mark the restriction register
  carries and AQL honours, `blocked-by S1`.
- **#3330** (outbox pruning ignores cursor readers) is unchanged and stays in
  v4.3.0; the plan depends on its `min(cursor)` floor.
- **#3323** (EHR_ACCESS default) is untouched by storage; it stays with #3322.
- **#3348** (the copy tool) and **#3349** (drop generation 1) are closed as not
  planned: a greenfield rewrite has nothing to copy and nothing left to drop
  (owner ruling 2026-09-14). The plan file is deleted by the PR that lands
  the last remaining sub-issue.
