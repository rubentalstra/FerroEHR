# W-14 — full code audit: every endpoint, every path (latency + error + optimization register)

Owner directive 2026-07-16 (expanded same day): **a FULL audit — not only the
high-p99 outliers. Probe everything: every endpoint, every request path, every
background path — find every place we can still optimize, and name every error
source.** Register-first like W-3c/W-3f: every row gets a receipt (measurement,
file:line, or an explicit "audited — nothing found" verdict) before any fix
wave starts. Branch: `claude/w14-audit`. Close: fix waves → fresh measured
pair → ECC zero-drift.

Standing rules apply: measured numbers only; spec citations only (never ADRs);
no test weakening; ECC baseline ratchets only upward.

## 0. Method

Three passes over the full surface, in order:

1. **Inventory** (this file, §1–§3): every HTTP endpoint, every background
   path, every cache, the full error surface — enumerated with file:line.
2. **Probe** (per-row): each row audited on both tracks —
   - **L (latency):** DB round-trips per request (count + shape), serial
     awaits that could parallelize, per-request allocation/serialization
     weight, lock/cache contention, N+1 loops, missing indexes vs the query
     shape, oversized responses.
   - **E (errors):** swallowed/discarded errors, wrong REST status mappings,
     `unwrap`-adjacent fallbacks, lossy `map_err`, error paths that
     log/allocate excessively, and the *named* sources of the measured ladder
     error rates (0.0052% at lf=16 → 0.0185% at lf=64 — pre-saturation, so
     these are real defects or admission artefacts, not overload).
3. **Verdict** per row: `OPT` (optimization filed, with expected win),
   `DEFECT` (error-handling defect filed), `CLEAN` (audited, receipt states
   what was checked), or `N/A` (not a runtime path). Fixes batch into waves;
   each wave ends with scoped gates; the phase ends with a fresh benchmark
   pair + ECC zero-drift run.

### Measured seeds (v3.0.3 pair, 2026-07-16 — the starting evidence)

Per-class p99 (hour run, ehrbase-rs, ms):

| class | n | p50 | p99 | max | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| comp-create-large | 4 | 79.6 | 128.0 | 128.0 | worst p99 — first probe target |
| comp-create-small | 213 | 39.9 | 93.9 | 99.6 | high n, p99 ~94 — write path |
| ehr-read | 2 | 82.4 | 91.1 | 91.1 | n=2, weak signal — re-measure |
| dir-update | 6 | 31.0 | 90.6 | 90.6 | |
| comp-update | 27 | 41.2 | 81.5 | 81.5 | |
| contribution-commit | 40 | 33.3 | 75.3 | 75.3 | |
| comp-read-latest | 501 | 22.0 | 74.6 | 147.6 | max 147 — tail outlier source? |
| aql-patient | 167 | 28.5 | 65.2 | 112.6 | |
| comp-read-version | 167 | 20.5 | 61.5 | 145.2 | max 145 — same tail question |
| dir-read | 43 | 18.1 | 49.0 | 49.0 | |
| status-update | 2 | 29.9 | 48.8 | 48.8 | |
| aql-ward | 14 | 19.6 | 39.4 | 39.4 | |
| ehr-create | 2 | 36.1 | 38.6 | 38.6 | |
| history-read | 21 | 13.5 | 33.4 | 33.4 | |

Knee-ladder error rates (pre-saturation errors are unnamed — E-track must
name every one): lf=16 → 0.0052%, lf=32 → 0.0079%, lf=64 (knee) → 0.0185%;
beyond the knee the shed layer answers cleanly (25–54% 503s, no OOM — W-12
behaviour, by design).

## 1. Endpoint register

<!-- populated from the full route inventory — one row per endpoint,
     columns: # | METHOD path | handler (file:line) | L-verdict | E-verdict | receipt -->

PENDING — inventory sweep in flight; populated in the next commit.

## 2. Background / long-running path register

PENDING — inventory sweep in flight.

## 3. Error-surface register

PENDING — inventory sweep in flight (error enums, status mapping seams,
swallow sites, ladder error-source naming).

## 4. Fix waves

Filed after the probe pass; each wave lists its rows, the change, the gate
receipts, and the re-measured numbers.

## 5. Exit criteria

- [ ] §1 has one row per endpoint (the count matches the router inventory)
      and every row carries an L and E verdict with a receipt.
- [ ] §2/§3 rows all verdicted; every ladder error at lf≤64 named.
- [ ] All `OPT`/`DEFECT` rows fixed or explicitly deferred with a reason the
      owner can read (no silent deferrals).
- [ ] Fresh benchmark pair (knee + hour, both SUTs' shape) committed —
      numbers only claimed from that run.
- [ ] ECC zero-drift run committed (baseline 370·335·0 or better).
- [ ] WORKLIST W-14 row closed with the merged PR link.
