## Additional non-openEHR surface

Beside the openEHR resources of ITS-REST 1.1.0, this product serves the route families below. **None of them is part of any conformance claim in this statement**: no openEHR specification governs them, no conformance case exercises them, and no verdict below depends on them. They are declared here so a reader of this document learns the surface exists rather than discovering it on the wire. Paths are the default deployment spelling; a non-default API base path moves the base-path-relative ones.

| Family | Routes | Enabled by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| health | `GET /health`<br>`GET /health/liveness`<br>`GET /health/readiness` | always on — no toggle; mounted outside the API base path and outside authentication (app/ferroehr-rest/src/extensions/health.rs) |
| server-status | `GET /ferroehr/rest/status` | always on — no toggle; mounted at the REST root (the base path minus /openehr/v1), outside authentication (app/ferroehr-rest/src/overview/status.rs) |
| openapi-meta | `GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-ehr.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-query.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-definition.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-demographic.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-admin.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-management.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-terminology.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-relationships.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-events.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-tenancy.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-fhir.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/api-docs/ferroehr-smart.openapi.json`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/swagger-ui`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/swagger-ui/{*file}` | server.swagger_ui (default on) for the whole family; the document paths follow server.openapi_json_path()/swagger_ui_path(), which derive from server.base_path |
| management | `GET /management/info`<br>`GET /management/prometheus`<br>`GET /management/metrics`<br>`GET /management/metrics/{name}`<br>`GET /management/env`<br>`GET /management/loggers`<br>`POST /management/loggers`<br>`DELETE /management/loggers` | observability management.enabled (default off); with management.port set the family moves to its own listener instead of the API listener — when off, the routes are absent (a router 404), not gated in-handler |
| terminology | `GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/terminology`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/terminology/{terminology_id}`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/terminology/{terminology_id}/term/{code}`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/terminology/{terminology_id}/subsumes`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/terminology/{terminology_id}/value_set/{value_set_id}`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/terminology/{terminology_id}/value_set/{value_set_id}/validate` | [terminology].api_enabled (default off); the gate sits in-handler behind authentication, so a disabled group answers 401 to an unauthenticated caller and 404 to an authenticated one |
| event-subscription | `GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/event_subscription`<br>`POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/event_subscription`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/event_subscription/{subscription_id}`<br>`PUT /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/event_subscription/{subscription_id}`<br>`DELETE /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/event_subscription/{subscription_id}` | [events].admin_api (default off); the gate sits in-handler behind authentication (401 unauthenticated, 404 authenticated when off) |
| tenancy | `GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/tenant`<br>`POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/tenant`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/tenant/{tenant_id}`<br>`PUT /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/tenant/{tenant_id}`<br>`DELETE /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/tenant/{tenant_id}` | [tenancy].enabled (default off); the routes stay mounted and answer 404 in-handler when off (401 first for an unauthenticated caller) |
| fhir-r4-connector | `POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/fhir/r4/{resource_type}`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/fhir/r4/{resource_type}` | [fhir].api_enabled (default off); the gate sits in-handler behind authentication and refuses with a FHIR OperationOutcome |
| fhir-mapping-store | `GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/fhir_mapping`<br>`POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/fhir_mapping`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/fhir_mapping/{mapping_id}`<br>`PUT /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/fhir_mapping/{mapping_id}`<br>`DELETE /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/fhir_mapping/{mapping_id}` | [fhir].api_enabled (default off) — the same gate as the connector, same in-handler posture |
| iti-81-audit-record-repository | `GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/fhir/r4/AuditEvent` | the local Audit Record Repository (ferroehr::system_log, on by default); answers 404 when the repository is disabled |
| party-relationship | `POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/demographic/party_relationship`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/demographic/party_relationship/{uid_based_id}`<br>`PUT /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/demographic/party_relationship/{uid_based_id}`<br>`DELETE /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/demographic/party_relationship/{uid_based_id}`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/demographic/versioned_party_relationship/{versioned_object_uid}`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/demographic/versioned_party_relationship/{versioned_object_uid}/revision_history`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/demographic/versioned_party_relationship/{versioned_object_uid}/version`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/demographic/versioned_party_relationship/{versioned_object_uid}/version/{version_uid}` | always on with the DEMOGRAPHIC group (no separate toggle) |
| stored-query-bare-list | `GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/query` | always on with the DEFINITION group (no separate toggle) |
| admin-extension-routes | `DELETE /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/template/{template_id}`<br>`DELETE /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/query/{qualified_query_name}/{version}`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/config` | [admin].enabled (default off) — the same gate as the released admin deletes; 405 with an empty Allow when off, RBAC Admin class by the /admin/ path (401 unauthenticated, 403 non-admin). COVERAGE, recorded per branch so an omission is ADJUDICATED instead of silent: NO catalogue case drives any of the three routes, and the reason is the catalogue's own anchoring model, not a choice. A case reaches the wire only through an operation binding, and a binding's `sm_operation` must resolve either against a vendored SM interface or against the runner's pinned non-SM table, which admits RELEASED ITS-REST operations only (register AMB-161) — and none of the three routes has such an anchor. (a) GET /admin/config: SM models NO configuration operation anywhere — i_admin_service.adoc declares list_contributions, contribution_count, versioned_composition_count, composition_version_count, physical_ehr_delete, physical_party_delete and nothing else, and no other SM interface names a configuration read — so no anchor exists to bind. (b) DELETE /admin/query/{qualified_query_name}/{version}: the only candidate, SM I_DEFINITION_QUERY.delete_query, is adjudicated NOT to be realized by this route — its Post_query_deleted, `not has_query (a_query_name)`, deletes by NAME and therefore every version, while this route removes one (name, version) row — so register AMB-127 keeps that operation `unrealized` and its binding must stay so for the SM-anchored case. (c) DELETE /admin/template/{template_id}: the only candidate, SM I_DEFINITION_ADL14.delete_opt, is `unrealized` under register AMB-17, and its four master04 cases gate Adl14OptProvisioning — a CORE `required: true` matrix row — so realizing that operation onto this extension route would rest a REQUIRED openEHR profile tier on a route no openEHR spec governs, which this family's own exclusion forbids. THE BRANCHES STILL TO BE CASED, listed so this is a worklist rather than a shrug: per route the success outcome (204 template delete, 204 stored-query-version delete, 200 config read), the RBAC pair (401 unauthenticated, 403 non-admin), the 404 miss on both deletes, and the 409 still-referenced refusal on the template delete. Meanwhile the RBAC classification of all three routes is pinned IN-PROCESS by app/ferroehr-rest/tests/it/authz_route_matrix.rs (the exhaustive route x role matrix, driving a roleless, ordinary, admin and read-only principal at every gated route) and the config read additionally by rbac_e2e.rs (401 / 403 / 200) and admin_http.rs (the gate-off 405 with its empty Allow, and the enabled 200) — evidence about this server's own gate, never about the CNF wire, and the two DELETEs' functional branches are pinned by the admin_http.rs battery (template: 204-then-gone, 404 unknown, 409 still-referenced-then-still-served; query version: 204-then-gone, 404 unknown — issue #2130). The gate-OFF 405 branch would in any case stay uncased for the topology reason the sibling admin-activity-report family records: a case cannot ask the SUT to be reconfigured mid-run and the ixit models no disabled-admin deployment. |
| adl14-archetype | `POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/archetype/adl1.4`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/archetype/adl1.4`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/archetype/adl1.4/{archetype_id}`<br>`DELETE /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/archetype/adl1.4/{archetype_id}` | always on with the DEFINITION group (no separate toggle) — the same posture as the released template routes. OPERATION CLASS is SPLIT: the POST and the two GETs carry the coarse `Clinical` class, while `DELETE /definition/archetype/adl1.4/{archetype_id}` carries `Admin` despite not sitting under /admin/ (our own design on the blast radius of destroying a deployment-wide definition artefact — SM openehr_platform master02-overview.adoc §Functional Style lists "approach to access control and authorisation" among the implementation choices and assumes authorisation "dealt with before any particular call has been made … and role-based access control", so no released clause governs it). BOTH RBAC branches of the delete are CASED: the authenticated non-admin refusal by I_DEFINITION_ADL14.delete_archetype-clinical_forbidden, the admitted branch by the delete steps of the semantics rows (delete_archetype-existing / -non_existing), which address the ixit `admin` instance. The Clinical half keeps its own branches CASED: read-only refusal (I_DEFINITION_ADL14.upload_archetype-readonly_forbidden step 1) and unauthenticated refusal (I_DEFINITION_ADL14.upload_archetype-unauthenticated). |
| adl2-archetype | `GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/archetype/adl2`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/archetype/adl2/count`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/artefact/adl2`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/artefact/adl2/count`<br>`DELETE /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/artefact/adl2/{artefact_id}` | always on with the DEFINITION group (no separate toggle). OPERATION CLASS is SPLIT: the four GETs carry the coarse `Clinical` class, while `DELETE /definition/artefact/adl2/{artefact_id}` carries `Admin` despite not sitting under /admin/ (our own design on the blast radius of destroying a deployment-wide definition artefact — SM openehr_platform master02-overview.adoc §Functional Style lists "approach to access control and authorisation" among the implementation choices and assumes authorisation "dealt with before any particular call has been made … and role-based access control", so no released clause governs it). BOTH RBAC branches of the delete are CASED: the authenticated non-admin refusal by I_DEFINITION_ADL2.delete_artefact-clinical_forbidden, the admitted branch by the delete steps of the semantics rows (delete_artefact-existing / -non_existing / -malformed_artefact_id), which address the ixit `admin` instance; the unauthenticated branch is swept route-table-wide by I_DEFINITION_ADL2.list_archetypes-unauthenticated. CONSEQUENCE for the read-only restriction: the delete was this family's ONLY write, so with it Admin-gated the restriction is unobservable on this family — delete_artefact-readonly_forbidden still drives a real 403 but it comes from the Admin gate, and the restriction itself is pinned on the ADL 2 group's remaining Clinical write, the released template upload (I_DEFINITION_ADL2.upload_artefact-readonly_forbidden). |
| admin-activity-report | `GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/report/contribution`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/report/contribution/count`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/report/versioned_composition/count`<br>`GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/report/composition_version/count` | [admin].enabled (default off) — the same gate as the released admin deletes; 405 with an empty Allow when off, RBAC Admin class by the /admin/ path (401 unauthenticated, 403 non-admin). BOTH RBAC branches are CASED (I_ADMIN_SERVICE.contribution_count-unauthenticated / -forbidden sweep all four routes). The gate-OFF 405 branch is NOT cased and the reason is topology, not vocabulary: a case cannot ask the SUT to be reconfigured mid-run, and the ixit models no disabled-admin deployment (the same adjudication the released admin-bulk-delete-disabled-405 element records, which this family's gate is literally the same code path as). Composing a second, admin-disabled deployment purely for this branch would double the stack for one status code that carries no clinical semantics, so the honest exclusion stands; the branch is HTTP-tested in-process (app/ferroehr-rest/tests/it/admin_extension_http.rs the_admin_gate_covers_the_extension_groups, which drives all four extension groups). |
| admin-archive | `POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/archive/ehrs`<br>`POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/archive/parties`<br>`POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/archive/ehrs/restore`<br>`POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/archive/parties/restore` | [admin].enabled (default off) — the same gate and RBAC class as the released admin deletes, for all four routes. Both RBAC branches of the ARCHIVE half are CASED per half (I_ADMIN_ARCHIVE.archive_ehrs-unauthenticated / -forbidden and the archive_parties siblings); the gate-OFF 405 branch is excluded for the same topology reason the admin-activity-report family records. THE TWO RESTORE ROUTES CARRY NO CATALOGUE CASE AT ALL, and the reason is the catalogue's own anchoring model rather than a choice — the same wall the sibling admin-extension-routes family records: a case reaches the wire only through an operation binding, a binding's sm_operation must resolve either against a vendored SM interface or against the runner's pinned NON_SM_REST_OPERATIONS table (which admits RELEASED ITS-REST operations only, register AMB-161), and i_admin_archive.adoc declares exactly archive_ehrs and archive_parties with no un-archive counterpart, so no anchor exists to bind. Binding the restore route as a variant of archive_ehrs / archive_parties would assert that it REALIZES that SM operation, which is false — it is the inverse movement, not a second wire for the same call — so the anchor is left absent rather than invented. THE BRANCHES STILL TO BE CASED, listed so this is a worklist rather than a shrug: per route the 204 success (including the restore-nothing no-op), the 400 malformed-id and wrong-shape refusals, the 404 unknown-id refusal, and the RBAC pair (401 unauthenticated, 403 non-admin). Meanwhile the RBAC classification of both routes is pinned IN-PROCESS by app/ferroehr-rest/tests/it/authz_route_matrix.rs (the exhaustive route x role matrix, which drives a roleless, ordinary, admin and read-only principal at every gated route and fails on any mounted route missing from its tables), the gate-OFF 405 by admin_extension_http.rs the_admin_gate_covers_the_extension_groups, and every functional branch by that file's restore battery (restoring_an_archived_ehr_makes_it_queryable_again, restoring_an_archived_party_moves_its_rows_back_to_the_primary_tier, restoring_an_unarchived_record_succeeds_and_changes_nothing, the_restore_routes_refuse_unknown_malformed_and_shapeless_requests) — evidence about this server's own behaviour, never about the CNF wire. |
| admin-dump-load | `POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/dump`<br>`POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/admin/load` | [admin].enabled (default off) — the same gate and RBAC class as the released admin deletes. Both RBAC branches are CASED over BOTH halves (I_ADMIN_DUMP_LOAD.export_ehrs-unauthenticated / -forbidden each drive export_ehrs and load_ehrs); the gate-OFF 405 branch is excluded for the same topology reason the admin-activity-report family records. |
| message-extract | `GET /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/message/export/{ehr_id}`<br>`POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/message/export`<br>`POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/message/import`<br>`POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/message/import/{ehr_id}` | always on with the API surface (no separate toggle); the ordinary clinical authentication class, NOT the /admin/ gate — SM places these operations in the MESSAGE component, not ADMIN, and the content they move is the same EHR content the released clinical routes serve. No openEHR spec governs the privilege level of an unspecified route: our own design/extension. |
| message-tdd | `POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/message/tdd/{ehr_id}`<br>`POST /ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/message/tdd/{ehr_id}/batch` | always on with the API surface (no separate toggle); the ordinary clinical authentication class — a TDD import commits a COMPOSITION through the same validated path the released composition_create uses. |
