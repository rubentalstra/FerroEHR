Owner rulings 2026-08-04 (angry, explicit, widened the same day): the
ambiguity register (`AMB-nnn`) is the CNF RUNNER'S machinery and its ids
are referenced ONLY inside the instrument's own repository
(Veredictum). The `openehr-*` crates
(published on crates.io) AND the `app/*` crates cite ONLY the vendored
openEHR spec text and official external docs — never an AMB id, never
instrument/catalogue paths, never the CNF schedule as the stated
authority.

**Why:** a published crate's docs reach docs.rs readers who have no repo;
internal register tokens are dead references there, and they leak the
conformance instrument into the spec layer.

**How to apply:** a spec-silent adjudication in a crate/app comment states
the decision + the released-text ground in place ("no released text assigns
X — adjudicated Y"); the register keeps pointing at the CODE, never the
other way. AMB ids stay legal only in Veredictum and in this repository's
`docs/`. Swept 2026-08-04 (10 crate sites + 128 app sites).
