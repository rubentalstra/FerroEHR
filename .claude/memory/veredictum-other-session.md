description: Veredictum is worked in another session; read it ONLY from the official remote repo — never the local checkout, never the ~/.cache/ferroehr-veredictum cache

Owner 2026-08-27, reinforced angrily 2026-08-31: never touch the Veredictum checkout, tracker state, or dispatches from the FerroEHR session — and NEVER read from the pipeline's local cache (`~/.cache/ferroehr-veredictum/<pin>/repo`) either. Every Veredictum read (register entries, catalogue cases, party material, release notes) goes to the official repo `github.com/rubentalstra/Veredictum` at the pinned tag, via `gh api`/raw URLs.

**Why:** the cache is the pipeline's private mechanism and may be stale, half-written, or mid-mutation by the conformance scripts; the other session owns the working checkout. The remote tag is the only authoritative, immutable read surface.

**How to apply:** `gh api repos/rubentalstra/Veredictum/contents/<path>?ref=v<pin>` (or the raw URL at the tag) for any file; `gh issue view N --repo rubentalstra/Veredictum` for tracker context. FerroEHR-side pin/integration work stays fair game. See [[session-workflow-gotchas]].
