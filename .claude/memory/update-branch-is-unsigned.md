Never refresh a stale pull-request branch with `gh pr update-branch` or the web "Update branch" button. Both create a merge commit through the GitHub API, which is unsigned, and the `main` ruleset requires signatures, so the PR sits at `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` with every check green and `verification.reason = "unsigned"` on the head commit.

**Why:** seen on #3432 (2026-09-16); a local `git rebase origin/main` plus force-push of the branch cleared it at once.

**How to apply:** `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main && git push --force-with-lease` on the PR branch, commits signed locally. Same root cause as [[api-commits-are-unsigned]].
