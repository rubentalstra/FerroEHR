**One closing keyword per issue.** `Closes #2261, #2264, #2265` closes only
**#2261** — GitHub parses the keyword against a single reference, not against a
comma list. Write `Closes #2261. Closes #2264. Closes #2265.` (or `Closes #2261,
closes #2264, closes #2265`).

**Why:** PR #2272 listed five issues behind one `Closes` and left four open
after merging. The work was done and merged; the tracker said otherwise, which
is the failure the auto-close exists to prevent.

**Every issue found en route goes in the CURRENT milestone.** Owner directive
(2026-08-11): "everything that comes up will be added to this milestone". Do not
file into the next milestone because something looks like follow-up work — the
owner decides what slips, and a milestone is the release's promise, so parking
work in the next one silently removes it from this cut.

How to apply:
- Repeat the keyword per issue, then VERIFY after merge (`gh issue view <n>
  --json state`) — the parse is silent when it fails.
- `gh issue create --milestone v<current>` on every new issue, including
  upstream-reports and follow-ups, unless the owner says otherwise. The one
  standing exception is `blocked-upstream`, which carries no milestone at all
  (it cannot promise a delivery).
