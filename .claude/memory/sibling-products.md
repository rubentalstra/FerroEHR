Four products, four repositories: FerroEHR (this repo, the CDR), FerroCKM (`../FerroCKM`, the Clinical Knowledge Manager, created 2026-09-03, BUSL-1.1 with FerroEHR's grant so the two share the application layer; research on its #1), FerroTERM (`../FerroTERM`, the FHIR terminology server; the local checkout was `../notio` until 2026-09-03 and the harness memory link was moved with it) and FerroBRIDGE (`../FerroBRIDGE`, the bridge from openEHR to HL7 FHIR (FHIRconnect spec, openFHIR as prior art) and to the OMOP CDM (OMOCL spec, Eos as prior art), created 2026-09-03). FerroEHR issues #2646 and #2652 were transferred there (FerroBRIDGE #1 and #2).

Licences: all four are Business Source License 1.1. FerroTERM and FerroBRIDGE were Apache-2.0 at creation (checked 2026-09-03) and the owner moved both to BUSL-1.1 on 2026-09-04 (stated in the FerroEHR session; not re-verified in their trees from here). Since the same day only the five generated `openehr-*` model crates are Apache-2.0; the three hand-written engines are BUSL, see [[license-busl]].

**Why:** the owner treats each as a separate product but wants the whole family under the same resale and hosting protection; the earlier plan to keep the bridge open source was reversed on 2026-09-04.

**How to apply:** never edit a sibling repo from a FerroEHR session unless the owner asks; when a FerroEHR text describes a sibling's licence, say BUSL-1.1 and, if it matters, check the sibling's `LICENSE` first-hand; FerroEHR's `ferroehr-ext` FHIR feature is expected to be retired in favour of FerroBRIDGE (#3080); FerroBRIDGE consumes FerroEHR strictly over ITS-REST, never as a crate dependency. See [[license-busl]].
