  change, when a "what does the law say about X" question comes up, or when
  a page cites a provision that needs checking against the text. Not for

# /law-lookup

Answer regulation questions from the vendored text at `docs/law/` — never
from memory, never from a publisher's live page. Every answer cites the
vendored file and the provision, quotes it verbatim in the authentic
language, and says who the provision binds. The discipline is
`.claude/rules/law-corpus.md`; this skill is its in-session form, and the
`compliance-researcher` agent is the same procedure run off the main context
for a whole act or a checklist.

## Procedure

1. **Route to the act** via `docs/law/README.md` (one table per jurisdiction,
   with the identifier, the consolidation vendored and the pages that cite
   it). Read the act's `PROVENANCE.md` first: it names the consolidation, the
   language, the sections the pages cite, and what is NOT vendored (a
   paywalled standard, an English translation at an older consolidation).
2. **Find the provision in the publisher's own format**, with grep/sed/perl
   over the vendored file — never a converted copy, because the numbering a
   citation resolves against must be the publisher's:
   - EU acts, `text.html`: `<div class="eli-subdivision" id="art_N">`; OJ
     texts also carry `<p class="oj-ti-art">Article N</p>`.
   - Dutch acts, `text.html`: `<div class="artikel" id="Hoofdstuk<H>_Artikel<N>">`.
   - German acts, `BJNR….xml` (the gii-norm DTD): one `<norm>` per section,
     `<enbez>§ N</enbez>` then `<titel>`, paragraphs as `<P>` inside
     `<Content>`. The DigiG is a PDF (`pdftotext`).
   - Swiss acts, `text-de.html` (authentic German) and `text-en.html` (the
     non-binding Fedlex English): `<article id="art_N">`, `<h6 class="heading">`,
     `<p class="absatz">`.
3. **Read the whole article and its neighbours**: the definitions article,
   the scope article (which Part of the act, which addressee, which date),
   and every article the provision cross-references. Scope before substance:
   a section that binds an insurer, an ePA operator, gematik, an EPD
   community, a supervisory authority or a law-enforcement body (BDSG Part 3
   is the standing trap) is not a duty on a care provider's CDR.
4. **Answer with**: the obligation as a testable statement; the verbatim
   quote in the authentic language (and the Fedlex English beside it where it
   exists, marked non-binding); the citation
   `docs/law/<jur>/<act>/<file> Art. N Abs. M` (`§ N Abs. M`, `Art. N(M)`,
   `Art. N lid M`); who it binds, with the scope citation; whether a list of
   measures is closed or a menu ("insbesondere", "such as"). If the text is
   silent or ambiguous, say so explicitly — a silent text is never filled in
   from general knowledge, and it is the signal for a "the text is silent"
   note on the page rather than a claim.
5. **Never give legal advice.** Report what the text says and what a software
   system would have to be able to do; whether a deployment meets it is the
   controller's judgement.

## What is deliberately not in the corpus

Standards sold under copyright (NEN 7510, 7512, 7513; ISO 27001/27799) hold
a record and no text: `docs/law/nl/nen-75xx/PROVENANCE.md` lists the clauses
the pages cite so a reader with a licensed copy can follow them. Do not
paraphrase a standard's clause from memory to fill the gap. State law
(German Länder, Swiss cantons) is out of scope and the README says so.
