Verified 2026-08-02 against RM 1.2.0
`docs/specs/openehr/RM/docs/common/master06-change_control_package.adoc`
lines 3–18 (§6.1 = TWO paragraphs + two figures; §6.2 Basic Semantics starts
line 19).

**§6.1's whole enforceable content:** (a) change control exists for
consistency/indelibility/traceability/distributed sharing (delegated to BASE
`architecture_overview/master08-versioning.adoc`, which IS vendored);
(b) `VERSIONED_OBJECT<T>` = a "version container" for ONE versioned item;
(c) versioning is "limited to 'top-level structures', such as EHR Compositions
and Party objects in a demographic system"; (d) **physical containment of
Versions by a Versioned object "is only one possible implementation"** — our
decomposed `vo_version`/`node` storage is EXPLICITLY sanctioned here, so cite
§Overview for it rather than the weaker "no openEHR spec governs this" flag.

**CONFORMANT, do not re-check:** the container wire builders
(`app/ferroehr/src/versioning/wire.rs:175-240` — EHR side owner_id
`{local, EHR, ehr_id}` matches AMB-69 + the CNF container_shape cases);
`VERSIONED_OBJECT` is NOT abstract in RM (only `VERSION<T>` is), so serving
`_type: VERSIONED_OBJECT` for a kind with no dedicated binding is legal;
the versioned-kind set is CHECK-constrained to 10 top-level structures
(`migrations/ehr/0001_baseline.sql:362`); indelibility holds — the ONLY
`DELETE FROM vo_version` is the ITS-REST ADMIN path
(`service/admin/delete.rs:452`) and the only `UPDATE vo_version` closes
`sys_period` (`storage/version_repo/commit.rs:261`); container type
homogeneity is enforced on the one path that could break it (import kind
mismatch, `versioning/import.rs:258`).

**VERIFIED DEFECTS:**
- ~~VERSIONED_PARTY `owner_id` three-way divergence~~ — **FIXED as of
  2026-08-02**: `service/demographic/support.rs:267` now emits
  `{local, SYSTEM, system_id}`, matching AMB-69, the released OAS example, and
  `service/message/export.rs:486`. ONE latent contradiction survives:
  `versioning/wire.rs:222`'s VersionedParty arm still builds
  `{local, EHR, ehr_id}`, reachable only through `service/message/export.rs:384`
  (`versioned_rm_type` maps the five party kinds at :93).
- **PARTY_RELATIONSHIP-as-its-own-version-container is unregistered spec
  tension.** RM demographic master02 §Versioning Semantics: "A Version of a
  PARTY includes all the compositional parts, such as … Party relationships of
  which it is the source"; §Party Relationships: "stored as part of the data of
  the PARTY designated as the source"; `PARTY.relationships` is an inline
  `List<PARTY_RELATIONSHIP>`. SM `i_party_relationship.adoc` contradicts it —
  `a_versioned_party_rel_id: UUID`, "Causes server-side creation of a new
  ORIGINAL_VERSION and CONTRIBUTION", `versioned_object_does_not_exist`. We do
  BOTH (own `kind='PARTY_RELATIONSHIP'` container + inline validation in
  `demographic/validate.rs:167`). AMB-32 covers only the missing WIRE; AMB-130
  only the defective invariants — neither asks whether a relationship is a
  §6.1 "top-level structure".
- **Dangling master06 headings:** `§Version tree` (17 sites, 14 files — real
  heading is "The 'Virtual Version Tree'"), `§Version subtypes` (2, real:
  "Version and its Subtypes"), plus the already-known `§Change Control` and
  `§CONTRIBUTION`.
- `{diagrams_uri}` PNGs still un-vendored (172 refs) — §6.1's
  `version_control_structures.png` is one, and the prose interprets it.
  Disclosed in each PROVENANCE.md, so an honest boundary, not a violation.
