# Claude Code PreToolUse hook (matcher: Write|Edit|NotebookEdit). Mechanical
# enforcement of the repo's "never hand-edit" hard rules (CLAUDE.md):
#
#   1. docs/specs/openehr/**            — vendored upstream openEHR spec text
#      (the conformance oracle); refreshed only by scripts/vendor/spec-docs.sh.
#      Exception: the top-level README.md (our own index).
#   2. tools/openehr-codegen/vendor/** — vendored BMM codegen inputs
#      crates/openehr-its/vendor/**     — vendored REST OAS
#      crates/openehr-its/schemas/**    — vendored XSD / ITS-JSON schemas
#      (re-vendor on a pin bump; never edit).
#   3. crates/openehr-its/src/**/generated/** — generator-owned output trees.
#   4. ANY existing file whose head carries an `@generated` marker — the
#      generated spec crates (openehr-base/rm/am, generated impls). Change
#      the emitter (tools/openehr-codegen) and regenerate (/regen-codegen);
#      never the output. (`openehr-codegen` itself writes via its own
#      process, not this tool, so it is unaffected.)
#
# Reads the tool-call JSON on stdin. Exit 2 blocks; exit 0 allows.
# Extended 2026-07-13 (was: docs/specs only). Filename kept stable so
# settings.json and concurrently-running sessions stay valid.
