# Force pushes: never to main/master. The judgement reads the `git push`
# SEGMENT of the command only (up to `;`, `|` or `&`), never the whole line,
# so an issue body or a commit message that mentions a force push is not one
# (#3359). The protected names match as WHOLE REF WORDS inside that segment
# (`refs/heads/main`, `origin main`, `HEAD:main` all hit), never as raw
# substrings, which falsely blocked branches whose names merely CONTAIN a
# protected name (fix/flat-master05-…, #542). A push that names no refspec
# is judged by the branch it would push: the CURRENT one.
# The segment must START a command (the line, or `;`, `|`, `&`, `(`, a
# subshell), optionally after variable assignments, so a `git push` quoted
# inside another command's argument is prose, not a push.
