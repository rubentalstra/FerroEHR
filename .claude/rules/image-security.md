# Published-image CVE remediation (the standing law)

The published container images are scanned continuously; this file is the
other half — what to DO with a finding, per finding class, so a fixable CVE
never sits waiting for someone to reinvent the remediation. Authored from
#2408, where 15 fixable HIGH findings sat in `ferroehr-postgres` because the
detection lane existed but the remediation path was tribal.

## The instrument layer (what fires when)

| Instrument | When | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| `containers.yml` image-scan job | every image build | what was known at build time |
| `image-scan.yml` | Mondays 07:13 UTC, on the PUBLISHED `:latest` refs | CVEs published after the release; files/updates ONE tracking issue and goes red |
| `base-image-watcher.yml` | Mondays 07:43 UTC | a newer `postgres` patch tag on the pinned major, or the pinned tag re-pointed upstream (a same-version security respin); files/updates ONE tracking issue |
| `scripts/security/scan-images.sh` | on demand, locally | reruns the EXACT published-image scan (same `trivy.yaml`, `.trivyignore.yaml`, `security/vex/*.json`) against the published refs or a locally built candidate |

All four read the same three config surfaces: `trivy.yaml` (severity floor +
`ignore-unfixed` + the ignore-file pointer), `.trivyignore.yaml` (per-CVE,
path-scoped adjudications), `security/vex/*.json` (the published arguments).
Never tune a lane by giving it its own flags — a lane that diverges from the
shared config silently changes what the gate means.

Platforms are explicit everywhere (#2412): the published index is dual-arch
(`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) and trivy reads ONE variant per invocation
(`--platform`, default `linux/amd64` — the Trivy container-image guide), so
each lane scans both variants; a locally built `--candidate` is
single-platform by construction and says so.

## The remediation law (per finding class)

Attribute every finding to exactly one class BEFORE touching anything, from
the scan JSON (`Target`, `PkgName`, `FixedVersion`):

1. **Bytes we add** (the Rust binaries, init scripts): fix the dependency or
   code the normal way. Rust advisories go through `deny.toml` +
   `security/vex/rust-advisories.toml` per `security/vex/README.md`, never
   through `.trivyignore.yaml`.
2. **OS package in the postgres image, fix available in Debian
   (trixie/trixie-security)**: already self-healing — the Dockerfile's
   security-upgrade `RUN` layer pulls fixed packages at build time. Remedy =
   rebuild + re-release (a patch release; images republish only on tags).
   Verify first: `docker build -t ferroehr-postgres:candidate docker/postgres/`
   then `scripts/security/scan-images.sh --candidate ferroehr-postgres:candidate`
   must report 0.
3. **A newer upstream base exists** (the watcher's issue, or found while
   remediating class 2): base bump, full pin-site checklist below.
4. **Upstream-bundled binary whose fix lives in ITS toolchain** (gosu: Go
   stdlib advisories — upstream must rebuild; we add no Go code): per-CVE
   reachability adjudication. If the vulnerable package is provably not in
   gosu's execute path (it sets uid/gid and execs: no sockets, no untrusted
   input), add the CVE to `.trivyignore.yaml` (path-scoped to
   `usr/local/bin/gosu`) AND its OpenVEX statement to
   `security/vex/postgres-gosu.openvex.json` (bump `version` + `timestamp`)
   in the same PR. If it IS reachable, do NOT VEX: that is a release blocker
   for the image — escalate to the owner (replace the binary or hold).
5. **Never**: raise the severity floor, add a blanket suppression, scope an
   ignore wider than one CVE × one path, or VEX a finding we can fix by
   rebuilding ("A finding we can fix is fixed, not VEXed" —
   `security/vex/README.md`).

A fixable finding in the PUBLISHED images is milestoned into the CURRENT
patch milestone — the remedy is only real once a tag republishes the image.

## The base-bump pin-site checklist (postgres)

Machine-enforced agreement (`scripts/checks/image-labels.sh`, per-PR in CI):
the Dockerfile `FROM` digest ↔ its `base.name`/`base.digest` LABELs ↔ the
`containers.yml` labels ↔ every workflow's postgres service pins (the guard
scans `.github/workflows/*.yml`, so a new lane's pin is covered the day it
lands; it read `ci.yml` alone until #2775 and missed `sonar.yml`). Everything else
is a sweep — run `grep -rn '18\.<old-patch>'` over the tree and expect to
touch:

- `docker/postgres/Dockerfile` — `FROM` tag+digest, header comment, both
  `base.*` LABELs (the digest is the MANIFEST-LIST digest:
  `docker buildx imagetools inspect postgres:<tag>` → `Digest:`)
- `.github/workflows/containers.yml` — postgres lane comment + both label lines
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — its service-container pin + the job heading
- `.github/workflows/sonar.yml` — its own service-container pin
- `docs/VERSIONS.md` §Database, `docs/postgres-features.md` §Versioning note
  (latest-patch version + date, from postgresql.org — never copied forward),
  root `CLAUDE.md` §Tech stack, `docs/architecture.md` §PostgreSQL 18,
  the root `Cargo.toml` database comment, `.claude/rules/sqlx-conventions.md`
- `app/ferroehr/src/telemetry/provenance.rs` `PG_TARGET` + its
  `build_info.rs` test
- `tools/testkit/src/lib.rs` header comment
- `docker/postgres/README.md`, `website/book/src/installation/compose.md`
- `deploy/helm/ferroehr/README.md.gotmpl` (then `helm-docs`), the chart
  `version` bump if chart content changed this cycle, and
  `deploy/helm/validate.sh --update` for the goldens

Then re-check the VEX documents: **when the new base rebuilds gosu, the
adjudicated gosu entries GO** (both the `.trivyignore.yaml` entries and the
OpenVEX statements) — a stale `not_affected` is worse than no VEX. Confirm
with the candidate scan: a VEX'd CVE that no longer fires is an entry to
delete.

## Verification (what "fixed" means)

`scripts/security/scan-images.sh --candidate <image>` at 0 findings on the
rebuilt image, BEFORE merge. The Monday `image-scan.yml` run over the
re-released `:latest` is the closing evidence; the tracking issue closes via
the fixing PR and the next scheduled run confirms (it files a fresh issue if
anything still fires — a closed issue is never silently final).
