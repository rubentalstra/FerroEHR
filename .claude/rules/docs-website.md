# The documentation website (`website/**`)

<!-- Path-scoped 2026-07-13: the global "same-PR docs" reminder lives in the
     root CLAUDE.md hard rules; this file carries the detail and loads when
     website files are touched. -->

The public site — https://ferroehr.eu/ — is built from
`website/` by `.github/workflows/docs.yml` and deployed to GitHub Pages.
No openEHR spec governs the website — our own design; this rule is the
authority for layout, look & feel, and content.

## Layout & URLs

- `website/landing/` — the hand-written landing page (root `/`). Relative
  URLs only; light+dark via `prefers-color-scheme`; zero external runtime
  requests.
- `website/book/` — the mdBook (served at `/docs/dev/`, frozen per release at
  `/docs/vX.Y.Z/`, newest release copied to `/docs/latest/`).
- `website/api/` — the OpenAPI endpoint reference (vendored Swagger UI + the
  served OAS copies).
- Frozen versions live on the `docs-dist` orphan branch (generate once,
  never rebuilt); `scripts/site/cut-version.sh vX.Y.Z` cuts one (CI does this on
  every `v*` tag).

## The same-PR docs rule (mirror of the changelog rule)

**Any PR that changes the REST surface, configuration (`FERROEHR_*`), the
CLI, deployment artifacts (compose/Helm/containers), or other user-visible
behaviour must update the matching `website/book/src` page in the same PR.**
The `/phase-done` checklist enforces it at phase close.

## Authoring rules

- End-user voice: second person, task-first. Audiences are integrators,
  operators, and evaluators — never repo-internal.
- **Never publish or link:** `docs/plans/**`,
  `docs/specs/**`, `.claude/**`. Paraphrase into user language instead.
- Callouts: mdBook 0.5 native `> [!NOTE]` / `[!WARNING]` / `[!TIP]` (no
  plugin syntax). Diagrams: ```mermaid fenced blocks. Long chapters get
  `<!-- toc -->` after the intro paragraph.
- **Math: `$…$` inline, `$$…$$` display** (mdbook-katex, pre-rendered at
  build time — no client JS, no CDN; the KaTeX CSS/fonts are self-hosted at
  `website/book/src/katex/`, version-locked to the renderer — see
  `website/book/KATEX-PROVENANCE.md`). Fenced code and inline code are never
  processed, so shell `$VAR` and Argon2 `$argon2id$…` strings are safe; a
  literal dollar in PROSE must be escaped `\$`. Use math for actual
  formulas (arrival schedules, derivations, bounds), not for every symbol —
  a ratio like 10:1 reads fine as prose.
- Every endpoint, header, status code, and config key must be verified
  against the code or the vendored OAS before it is written down.

## What a gate checks, and what only review can (#1984)

The v3.17.4 book sweep found five substantive defects that had already shipped
to the published site, and no gate had caught any of them: `mdbook-lint`
checks style, `lychee` checks that links resolve, and both pass on a page
whose every technical claim is false. Per the reliability convention that an
unenforced rule is labelled as one, here is the honest split.

**Machine-checked** — `scripts/checks/docs-claims.sh`, the `docs-claims` CI
job, `--all` over the whole book:

- Every `FERROEHR__…` environment form resolves to a key in
  `app/ferroehr/assets/ferroehr.default.toml`.
- Every Helm values path on a chart page resolves — against `values.yaml`, or
  for `config.*` against the TOML schema, since the chart renders `config:`
  verbatim into `ferroehr.toml`.
- Every committed chart under a `*-assets/` directory is embedded by a page or
  by an mdBook `{{#include}}` source.

**Review-only, deliberately:**

- **Documented Rust paths.** A grep-level existence check for `crate::a::b` /
  `openehr_x::y::Z` was measured and rejected: prose names types under a
  different module path than the sentence implies, and the generated crates'
  generation modules give one type several valid paths. It found less than it
  cried wolf about.
- **Prose claims** — "six endpoints exist", "the chart renders one key",
  behaviour descriptions of any kind. No machine authority exists for these,
  which is exactly why the same-PR rule above still carries the weight.

A guard is only worth having if it is trusted, so when `docs-claims` reports
something, check whether the *guard* is wrong before editing the page: its
first run reported a published chart as orphaned because it searched only
`website/book/src` and the reference lived in `website/book/generated`.

## Never hand-edit

- `website/api/spec/**` — produced by `scripts/site/assemble-oas.sh` from the
  vendored ITS-REST bundles (CI drift gate `--check` fails otherwise).
- `website/api/vendor/**`, `website/book/theme/mermaid*` — vendored assets.

## Toolchain

Pinned in `docs.yml` `env` (mdBook, mdbook-mermaid, mdbook-toc, mdbook-lint,
lychee, Swagger UI). Bump only after live-verifying the new version.

## Local preview

`bash scripts/site/build.sh` then serve `_site/`
(`npx --yes serve _site`, or any static server). CI equivalence is the point — if it
works locally it works deployed.
