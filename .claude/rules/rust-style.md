# Rust style — idiomatic application code

Applies to hand-written `.rs`: the application (`ferroehr`, `ferroehr-rest`,
`ferroehr-server`, `ferroehr-admin-ui`), the tools (`cnf-runner`,
`testkit`, `openehr-codegen`), the hand-written spec
crates (`openehr-its`, `openehr-term`, `openehr-query`, the
tooling crates), and `*_impl.rs` behaviour files. **The application is modern idiomatic Rust of our own design, built on the
generated `openehr-*` crates**. The openEHR specifications are
the authority; EHRbase and other CDRs are prior art only.

**Generated files are off-limits.** The openEHR spec/ITS crates (`openehr-base`,
`openehr-rm`, `openehr-am`, and the generated code in `openehr-its`) are produced
by `openehr-codegen`; every `// @generated` file **must never be hand-edited** —
change the emitter and regenerate (`cargo run -p openehr-codegen -- emit`/
`emit-xml`/`emit-rest`).

## Build idiomatic, compiling, tested code

- **Consume the generated crates directly** as the domain model (`openehr-rm`,
  `openehr-am`, `openehr-term`, `openehr-query`, `openehr-its`). Never re-model
  the RM or re-serialize.
- **Use proper crates; don't hand-roll** what the ecosystem provides — `axum`/
  `tower-http`, `sqlx`+`sea-query`, `oauth2`/`openidconnect`/`jsonwebtoken`/
  `argon2`, `utoipa`, `moka`, `jiff`, `uuid`. Add deps only from
  `Cargo.toml [workspace.dependencies]` (`dep.workspace = true`).
- **Every crate you touch compiles + is clippy-clean + tested before you move
  on.**
- **Read the vendored spec first for any spec-facing behaviour** — the
  normative text + CNF schedule live at `docs/specs/openehr/` (use
  `/spec-lookup`; full rule in `spec-adherence.md`).
- **The specs are the authority; design the bespoke logic ourselves** (AQL
  engine, versioning, validation, node codec), verified by the CNF
  conformance suite + corpus tests. Consult prior art (upstream EHRbase, other
  CDRs) when useful; never port it blindly.

## Comments & documentation

The comment/doc-comment discipline lives in **`comments.md`** (RFC 505 +
RFC 1574): line comments only, `// TODO(#NNNN):` / `// NOTE:` / `// SAFETY:`
as the only markers, NOTE = citation + one sentence (≤3 lines), `//` runs
≤8 lines, doc-comment summary-line + section conventions. Enforced by
`scripts/checks/comment-style.sh` (hook + CI) and
`clippy::too_long_first_doc_paragraph`.

## Default values live in the struct's `Default` impl (owner directive 2026-08-06)

The shape is RFC 3681's
(<https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3681-default-field-values.html>), written by
hand: **one** `impl Default` per struct, every default value inline, and
container-level `#[serde(default)]` so serde fills omitted fields from it.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize)]
#[serde(default, deny_unknown_fields)]
pub struct OidcConfig {
    pub issuer: String,
    pub clock_skew_leeway_seconds: u64,
}

impl Default for OidcConfig {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            issuer: String::new(),
            clock_skew_leeway_seconds: 60,
        }
    }
}
```

The RFC's own syntax (`clock_skew_leeway_seconds: u64 = 60`) is **nightly-only**
— feature `default_field_values`, tracking issue
<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/132162>, implemented with no
stabilization PR — and this project pins stable (`docs/VERSIONS.md`), so the
expansion above is the form we write. When the feature stabilizes, the
declaration replaces the `impl` block and the guard's rules stop mattering; do
not adopt it before then, and do not reach for nightly to get it.

Three forms are banned, because each one puts a field's default value somewhere
other than the field's own struct:

- **`#[serde(default = "path")]`** — the per-field path form. The default then
  lives in a function, so `Default::default()` and a deserialized value can
  silently disagree about the same field. Container-level `#[serde(default)]`
  (no path) is the required form and reads the one `Default` impl.
- **`fn default_x() -> T`** — a zero-argument constructor that exists to be one
  field's default. (A function that takes arguments and happens to start with
  the word — `default_provider(&self)`, `default_committer(&self)` — is an
  ordinary domain function and is fine.)
- **`const DEFAULT_X` with a single reader** — a constant that nothing shares is
  a default value spelled far from its struct.

A `const` with MORE THAN ONE consumer stays a constant and may be referenced
from inside the `Default` impl: a spec-fixed value with several readers
(`service::DEFAULT_SYSTEM_ID`) is a single source of truth, which is the
opposite of the problem above.

Enforcement (tier 4): `scripts/checks/default-style.sh` — per-edit via the
`rust_fmt_clippy.sh` hook, per-PR via the `default-style` CI job (`--all`).

## HTTP statuses are compared as types (owner directive 2026-08-06)

An HTTP status is a `StatusCode`, and it is compared as one:

```rust
if status == StatusCode::OK { … }          // yes
if status.as_u16() == 200 { … }            // no
```

`http::StatusCode` names every registered code
(<https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/status/struct.StatusCode.html>), so there is
always a constant. A numeric comparison throws away the type the crate exists to
provide, and a bare literal tells a reader nothing about which member of a family
was meant — `403` versus `404` is a one-character typo the compiler cannot catch.

Rendering the number stays legal, because that is not a comparison: a log field, a
metric label, a recorded wire outcome, a `/ 100` class bucket. Only comparison
against a numeric literal is refused.

Enforcement (tier 4): `scripts/checks/typed-status.sh` — per-edit via the
`rust_fmt_clippy.sh` hook, per-PR via the `default-style` CI job (`--all`, since
the tree has no violations).

## RFC-grounded conventions and where each one is enforced

Surveyed 2026-08-06 against the accepted-RFC corpus (<https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/tree/master/text>),
each item's stabilization status verified first-hand. The point of the table is
that a convention with no check is labelled as such rather than assumed.

| RFC | The rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| 0505 + 1574 | comment/doc conventions | `comments.md` + `scripts/checks/comment-style.sh` + `too_long_first_doc_paragraph` |
| 3681 | a field's default lives inline in its `Default` impl | §Default values above + `scripts/checks/default-style.sh` |
| 3107 | `#[derive(Default)]` + `#[default]` where the default is a VARIANT | `clippy::derivable_impls` (deny) — hand-write `impl Default` only for VALUES |
| 0199 / 0344 / 0430 | `as_`/`to_`/`into_` cost conventions, naming | `clippy::wrong_self_convention` (`clippy::all`, deny) + rustc naming lints |
| 1940 | `#[must_use]` on functions whose result is the point | `clippy::must_use_candidate` (pedantic → deny) |
| 2383 | every suppression carries `reason = "…"` | `clippy::allow_attributes_without_reason` (deny) |
| 1946 | intra-doc links over bare paths | `rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links` (deny) + the CI doc job |
| 3013 | no typo'd `cfg` predicates | `unexpected_cfgs` (deny) |
| 3373 | no `impl` inside a fn body | `non_local_definitions` (deny) |
| 3389 | lints configured in the manifest, not `#![allow]` sprinkles | the `[workspace.lints]` table IS this |
| — | zero re-exports: every import names its defining module | `clippy::pub_use` (deny) — the generated crates' preludes carry an emitter-stamped `#![expect]` |
| 0201 + 0236 | **an error carries its cause** (`Error::source`) | `scripts/checks/error-source-chain.sh` — a per-tree RATCHET (counts may only fall) while the #2034 sweep runs |
| 2294 | `if let` guards on match arms (stable 1.95.0, one release under our MSRV) | review-only — a genuine wish, labelled as one |

**Rejected on merit, so nobody re-files them as gaps:**

- `clippy::self_named_module_files` (RFC 2126 module conventions) — 25 files
  match, ALL generated. `composition/composition.rs` is the emitter mirroring
  the BMM package `composition` and its class `COMPOSITION`; converting it to
  `mod.rs` would merge the class module into the package module and change
  published paths (`openehr_rm::v1_2::composition::composition::Composition`).
  The spec-mirroring layout wins.
- `clippy::exhaustive_enums` (RFC 2008) and RFC 0356 — both adjudicated in
  `reliability.md` §Recorded deviations.

**The one real gap: error chaining.** RFC 0201 makes the cause chain part of
the `Error` contract, and 109 `map_err(|e| Variant(e.to_string()))` sites
flatten it against 48 that carry `#[source]`/`#[from]`. A stringified cause
cannot be walked, matched, or logged structurally — the same silent-context-loss
class `reliability.md` legislates for `Result → Option`, except this one CAN be
checked. New code carries the source; the sweep is tracked.

## Type and error conventions

- `thiserror` error enums in library crates; `anyhow` only in the `ferroehr`
  binary. No `unwrap`/`expect` outside `#[cfg(test)]`; `todo!()` is denied
  workspace-wide (owner rule 2026-07-12) — an unready dependency gets a typed
  error or real code, never a panic placeholder.
- Closed openEHR subtype sets are already Rust `enum`s in `openehr-rm`; consume
  them. Trait objects only for genuinely open, runtime polymorphism.
- Back-references use `Weak<..>` or an index, never an owning reference; recursive
  containment is boxed (the generated crates already do this).
- `std::sync::LazyLock` (edition 2024) for statics, not `once_cell`.
- **No `use X as Y` import renaming (owner hard rule, 2026-07-11).** Import
  types under their direct names. An alias papers over a naming problem —
  if the name is bad, FIX THE NAME at its definition; if two imports
  genuinely collide, qualify one at the use site (full path) instead of
  renaming. Only alias in highly exceptional cases where no other solution
  exists, with a comment saying why. (Trait imports as `use Trait as _;`
  are not renames and are fine.)
- Edition 2024, resolver v3, MSRV 1.96. `cargo fmt` clean; run `cargo clippy` on
  the crate you touched before considering it done.
- **Suppressions are `#[expect(lint, reason = "…")]`**, scoped to the smallest
  item; `#[allow(lint, reason = "…")]` only for cfg/feature-conditional fire
  (full policy: reliability.md §When a lint fights a legitimate case —
  `allow_attributes_without_reason` is deny). The one sanctioned
  logically-impossible-`Err` escape is also there (Book ch9 shape:
  should-phrased message + inspection-proving reason).

## Documentation (missing_docs is enforced workspace-wide)

- Every public item carries a doc comment (rustc `missing_docs`; generated
  crates get theirs from the emitter — never hand-edit `// @generated`).
  Shape, sections, and summary-line rules: `comments.md` (RFC 1574).
- Intra-doc links (`[`Type`]`) resolve in the scope of the module where the
  item is DEFINED — which under the zero-re-exports rule is also where
  readers import it from. `rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links` is deny; the CI
  doc job is the gate. Literal square brackets in prose are escaped `\[…\]`.
- `#[doc(alias = "EHR_STATUS")]`-style aliases on spec-named types are
  encouraged — rustdoc search then finds the Rust type from the openEHR
  spelling.

## Edition-2024 standing guidance (behaviour that compiles fine and differs)

- **`if let` scrutinee temporaries drop before `else`** — the guard rule
  lives in reliability.md; rewrite as `match` when a guard must span arms.
- **Never-type fallback**: `f()?;` on a fn generic over the `Ok` type can
  now infer `!` — annotate the turbofish/binding type at such call sites
  instead of leaning on inference
  (https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2024/never-type-fallback.html).
- **RPIT captures every in-scope lifetime by default** — when a returned
  `impl Trait` must NOT capture one, say so with precise capturing
  (`use<…>`); the old `Captures<..>` trick is obsolete
  (https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2024/rpit-lifetime-capture.html).
- **`Future`/`IntoFuture` are in the prelude** — a collision with a local
  trait method is resolved with fully-qualified syntax
  (`<T as MyTrait>::poll(…)`), never an import rename (the no-alias rule
  stands).
- The `unsafe_*` 2024 items are all moot under `unsafe_code = "forbid"`;
  `static_mut_refs` is compiler-enforced and the `LazyLock` convention
  already complies. Do not re-litigate them.

## No Python, anywhere (owner hard rule, 2026-08-10)

The tooling languages are **bash and Rust**. Python is banned across the
repository — standalone scripts, and especially embedded in shell.

Embedded is worse than either language alone, and not as a matter of taste: a
heredoc nested inside a command substitution makes bash scan the *Python* for
quote pairs, so a single apostrophe in a Python comment breaks the whole
script with an error pointing at the wrong line. That is not hypothetical — it
happened while writing `scripts/render/zenodo-json.sh`, which is now bash and
`jq` only.

What to reach for instead:

| Job | Tool |
|---|---|
| JSON read/build | `jq` |
| Line scans, field extraction | `awk`, `sed`, `grep` |
| Anything with real data structures | Rust, in `tools/` |

Enforcement (tier 4): `scripts/checks/no-python.sh`, per-PR via the
`no-python` CI job. It fails on any `python`/`python3` invocation and on any
`.py` file under `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`, `.claude/hooks/`, `deploy/`
and `docker/`; prose *about* not using Python is allowed, since several
scripts carry exactly that comment. Mutation-proven in both directions.

**There are no exemptions.** The last two were the Helm selector-immutability
and restricted-profile gates, which parsed multi-document YAML; they are now
`yq -o=json | jq` gate programs under `deploy/helm/gates/`, with every
assertion re-proven against the same mutations the Python caught.

## What not to do

- Do not port JVM plumbing (classloaders, Spring context internals, PF4J) —
  design the idiomatic Rust equivalent (tower middleware, axum state, a Rust
  plugin model) or register it as its own tracker issue with a `// TODO(#NNNN):`.
- Do not hand-edit generated code; do not re-model what `openehr-*` provides.
