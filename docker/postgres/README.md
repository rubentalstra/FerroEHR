# ferroehr-postgres

A preconfigured PostgreSQL 18 image for FerroEHR, mirroring the official
`ehrbase/ehrbase-v2-postgres` two-image model built fresh for this stack
(the greenfield PG18 storage design, `docs/architecture.md` §Storage). It is `postgres:18.6` plus Debian
security updates applied at image build (the pinned upstream base rebuilds on its own cadence, so
trixie-security fixes are pulled in at OUR build time) plus one-time init scripts.

## What the init scripts create

Run once, on an empty data directory, as the bootstrap superuser
(`POSTGRES_USER`) — see `initdb/10-ferroehr-init.sh`:

- a **non-superuser** login role (default `ferroehr`) and a **database it owns**
  (default `ferroehr`);
- the six NOLOGIN group roles — **`ferroehr_migrator`** and the five domain
  roles **`ferroehr_clinical`**, **`ferroehr_clinical_reader`**,
  **`ferroehr_party`**, **`ferroehr_party_reader`** and **`ferroehr_linkage`**,
  each `NOINHERIT` — with the login role granted the migrator and the three
  writer roles, so dev/compose has the same grant topology as a hardened
  deployment. It is one credential playing every part: this stack shows the
  schema separation, not the credential separation, which a deployment reaches
  by giving each domain its own DSN;
- schemas **`clinical`**, **`ext`** and **`audit`** (the local IHE ATNA Audit
  Record Repository), owned by the app role. The other two storage schemas,
  **`party`** and **`linkage`**, are left to the server: `ferroehr::db::prepare`
  creates all five itself before the first migrator runs, and the app role owns
  the database, so it needs no help with the two this script omits;
- **`btree_gist`** in `ext`, the one extension the schema needs (it backs the
  temporal `linkage.subject_ehr` `UNIQUE (... WITHOUT OVERLAPS)`), installed
  **by the superuser** so the app role never needs the privilege.

The server's own bootstrap then finds this in place: its
`CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS {ext,clinical,party,linkage,audit}` and
`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gist WITH SCHEMA ext` become no-ops for
what the script already made, and it migrates the schema **content** into the
five sets.

## Init-scripts only — NO baked migration state (policy)

The image ships **roles, schemas, and extensions only**. It never bakes the
migrated schema (tables, functions, `_sqlx_migrations`) into the image.

Why: the app's sqlx migrators own the schema content and run idempotently at
every boot (a per-schema `_sqlx_migrations` ledger makes re-runs no-ops).
Baking migration state into the image would couple the two images' release
cycles for zero gain and risk a checksum mismatch between a stale baked schema
and the running binary's embedded migrations. The single source of truth for
schema content is `app/ferroehr/migrations/{ext,clinical,party,linkage,audit}/`,
applied at boot. This
is also the official EHRbase precedent (its postgres image is init-scripts
only).

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | *(required by the base image)* | bootstrap **superuser** (`postgres`) password |
| `PG_INIT_USER` | `ferroehr` | app login role created by the init script |
| `PG_INIT_PASSWORD` | `ferroehr` | app role password (**dev default — override in production**) |
| `PG_INIT_DB` | `ferroehr` | app database created by the init script |

These `PG_INIT_*` vars configure this DB container; they are intentionally
outside the server's reserved `FERROEHR_` namespace (the server rejects unknown
`FERROEHR_*` vars at boot). The app then connects with, e.g.,
`FERROEHR__DB__URL=postgres://ferroehr:ferroehr@<host>:5432/ferroehr`.

Init scripts only run on first initialisation (empty volume). To re-provision,
remove the data volume (`docker compose down -v`).
