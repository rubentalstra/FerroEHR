# End-to-end smoke test for the two container images (amd64), run against the
# TRUE end-user artifact: the standalone docker-compose.yml, pinned with an
# explicit -f. (The dev overlay stopped auto-merging in #2868 — its explicit
# name keeps this pin as belt-and-braces, not as the defence.)
#
# Only postgres + the server start (the viewer sits behind the
# `viewer` profile). The server configuration is the quickstart posture the
# compose `configs:` block carries inline — Basic user ferroehr/ferroehr,
# RBAC off. The steps:
#   1. waits for the app healthcheck to report healthy;
#   2. asserts GET /rest/status returns 200;
#   3. creates an EHR with the dev Basic credentials (ferroehr/ferroehr);
#   4. restarts the app and proves the second-boot migration run is a no-op
#      (the sqlx ledger is unchanged — the library migrator is silent on no-op,
#      so the row count is the reliable idempotency signal; app logs are dumped
#      for visibility);
#   5. tears everything down.
#
# FERROEHR_IMAGE / FERROEHR_POSTGRES_IMAGE select the images to run.
