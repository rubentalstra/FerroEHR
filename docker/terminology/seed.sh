# Seed the composed FHIR R4 terminology server with the CNF test terminologies.
#
# POSIX sh ON PURPOSE (the one non-bash script in the tree): the terminology
# container runs this via /bin/sh and ships no bash, so bash-only constructs
# ([[ ]] included) must stay out of this file.
#
# Runs as a one-shot init container of the `terminology` compose profile, after
# the server answers its own capability statement. Everything it writes is
# SYNTHETIC test content under the reserved example.test domain (IETF RFC 6761
# §6.2): two code systems and their enumerated value sets, one SNOMED-CT-shaped
# (hierarchical, numeric codes) and one LOINC-shaped (NNNNN-N codes; the
# namespace is deliberately named "lab-shaped": HAPI FHIR special-cases any
# ValueSet canonical URL CONTAINING the substring "loinc" and its url-based
# $expand then answers HAPI-2788 "Unknown ValueSet" for stored, searchable,
# by-id-expandable content — verified empirically against
# hapiproject/hapi:v8.10.0-3, 2026-07-29: loinc-shaped-vitals/loinc-x 404,
# identical content at lab-shaped-vitals/zz-vitals 200. No openEHR spec
# governs any of this — our own test infrastructure). No
# licensed terminology content is distributed here.
#
# IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION: every resource is written with `PUT
# /<type>/<id>`, the FHIR "update as create" interaction
# (hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#update), so re-running the seeder against a server
# that already holds them is a no-op update rather than a duplicate. The stock
# HAPI image keeps its H2 database in memory, so a terminology-container
# restart drops the seed — re-run this step (or the whole profile) after one.
