# Resource walkthroughs

This chapter walks through the core openEHR resources — **EHR**, **EHR_STATUS**,
**COMPOSITION**, **DIRECTORY**, **CONTRIBUTION** and **ITEM_TAG** — with real
`curl` examples you can adapt. For each resource it shows the operations, the
headers they need, and the status codes they return. Paths are relative to the
base `/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1` (see [Using the API](index.md)); examples use
Basic auth (`-u ferroehr:ferroehr`) and JSON. Content negotiation, the `Prefer`
header, and `ETag`/`If-Match` versioning are cross-cutting and get their own
chapter, [Content negotiation & errors](content-negotiation.md); this chapter
uses them in context.

**Datetime parameters.** Several operations below take a point in time
(`version_at_time`, the CONTRIBUTION `time_range` bounds). Write it in the
_extended_ ISO 8601 form — `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss[Z|±hh:mm]`, e.g.
`2016-06-23T13:42:16.117+02:00`. The timezone is optional: leave it off
(`2016-06-23T13:42:16`) and the value is read in the **server's** local
timezone, so supply `Z` or an explicit offset whenever the client's timezone may
differ from the server's. The time itself is required — a bare date
(`2016-06-23`), the compact "basic" ISO form (`20160623T134216Z`), a
zone-annotated form (`2016-06-23T13:42:16[Europe/Amsterdam]`), and anything
unparseable all return **400 Bad Request**.

## EHR

An **EHR** is the top-level container for one subject's health record.

### Create an EHR

```shell
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr -X POST -i \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr
```

`POST /ehr` — the body is optional; you may supply an `EHR_STATUS` to set the
subject and flags at creation. Returns **201 Created** with the new EHR id in
`ETag` and a `Location` header. With `Prefer: return=representation` the body is
the full `EHR`; otherwise it is empty. Supplying an `EHR_STATUS` whose subject
already has an EHR returns **409 Conflict**.

To create with a specific id, use `PUT /ehr/{ehr_id}` (also 201; 409 if that id
is already used).

### Retrieve an EHR

```shell
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/$EHR_ID
```

`GET /ehr/{ehr_id}` returns **200** with the `EHR`, or **404** if unknown. You
can also look one up by subject: `GET /ehr?subject_id=…&subject_namespace=…`
(both parameters required).

The `EHR` root object is not itself versioned, so its reads carry a weak `ETag`
built from `EHR.ehr_id.value` but no `Last-Modified`.

## EHR_STATUS

**EHR_STATUS** holds the record's metadata — the link to the subject, and the
`is_queryable` / `is_modifiable` flags. It is itself versioned.

Setting `is_modifiable` to `false` **deactivates** the EHR: any attempt to
create, update, or delete its content — a composition, the directory, or a
folder — is refused with **409 Conflict**, through *every* write path including a
CONTRIBUTION commit. The EHR_STATUS itself stays writable (so you can set the
flag back to `true` to reactivate), and reads and queries are unaffected.

### Read the current status

```shell
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/$EHR_ID/ehr_status
```

`GET /ehr/{ehr_id}/ehr_status` returns the current `EHR_STATUS`, its version id
in `ETag`. Add `?version_at_time=<ISO 8601>` to read it as of a point in time.
`GET …/ehr_status/{version_uid}` reads a specific version.

### Update the status

Updates require the current version id in an `If-Match` header (optimistic
concurrency):

```shell
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr -X PUT \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'If-Match: "<current-version-uid>"' \
  -H 'Prefer: return=representation' \
  --data-binary @ehr-status.json \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/$EHR_ID/ehr_status
```

`PUT /ehr/{ehr_id}/ehr_status` returns **200** (with representation) or **204**
(minimal), plus the new `ETag`. A stale or wrong `If-Match` returns **412
Precondition Failed** with the current version id in `ETag`.

### Status version history

The `versioned_ehr_status` sub-resource exposes the full version history:

- `GET …/versioned_ehr_status` — the `VERSIONED_EHR_STATUS` object,
- `GET …/versioned_ehr_status/revision_history` — the revision history,
- `GET …/versioned_ehr_status/version` (optionally `?version_at_time=`) and
  `…/version/{version_uid}` — a specific version.

## COMPOSITION

A **COMPOSITION** is a committed clinical document, validated against its
template.

### Create a composition

```shell
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Prefer: return=representation' \
  --data-binary @composition.json \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/$EHR_ID/composition
```

`POST /ehr/{ehr_id}/composition` returns **201 Created** with the version id in
`ETag`. A body that cannot be **constructed** as a COMPOSITION — malformed JSON,
an undeclared or repeated member, a missing mandatory attribute, an empty list
the model requires non-empty, a `_type` foreign to its slot — is **400 Bad
Request**: parsing is the shape check, so structural defects never reach
validation. A body that constructs but fails **semantic** validation (template
constraints, RM invariants, terminology bindings) returns **422 Unprocessable
Entity** with the errors; an unknown EHR, **404**.

### Retrieve a composition

```shell
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/$EHR_ID/composition/$UID
```

`GET /ehr/{ehr_id}/composition/{uid_based_id}` accepts either a full version id
(`<uuid>::<system>::<n>`) or a bare object uuid (in which case add
`?version_at_time=` to pick a point in time). It returns **200** with the
composition, **204** if the composition was (logically) deleted at that time, or
**404**.

### Update and delete

```shell
# Update — If-Match is the CURRENT version id; the URL uses the bare object uuid
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr -X PUT \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'If-Match: "<current-version-uid>"' \
  --data-binary @composition.json \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/$EHR_ID/composition/$OBJECT_UUID

# Delete — the URL uses the FULL version id
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr -X DELETE \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/$EHR_ID/composition/$VERSION_UID
```

`PUT` returns **200**/**204** (per `Prefer`) with the new version id, **412** on
an `If-Match` mismatch, **422** on validation failure. `DELETE` is a *logical*
delete — the history is retained — returning **204** with the new deleted
version's `ETag`; deleting something already deleted returns **400**, and a
version id that is not the latest returns **409**.

> [!WARNING]
> Watch the id you pass. `PUT` takes the **object uuid** (the versioned object),
> while `DELETE` takes the **full version id** (the version you are
> superseding). `GET` accepts either.

> [!NOTE]
> A version's lifecycle state (set through the `openehr-version:
> lifecycle_state.code_string` header — see
> [Content negotiation & errors](content-negotiation.md); the default on a
> commit is `532|complete|`) must follow the openEHR version-lifecycle state
> machine. An illegal transition is rejected with **422 Unprocessable Entity**
> naming the states. In particular, a version left in the `801|abandoned|`
> state cannot be updated straight to `complete` — you must first retrieve it
> back to `553|incomplete|`, then complete it.
>
> Two further rules apply to the state a commit may claim:
>
> - **`523|deleted|` belongs to `DELETE` alone.** Deleting is one act — a new
>   version whose data is removed and whose state is `deleted` — so a `PUT`
>   or `POST` that carries content may not claim it. Such a request is
>   rejected **422**. Conversely, a `DELETE` that supplies a lifecycle other
>   than `523|deleted|` is rejected **400**: the value would have to be
>   discarded, and the server tells you rather than pretending to honour it.
>   A `DELETE` with no lifecycle header at all is the normal case and is
>   unaffected.
> - **`553|incomplete|` relaxes what a commit must contain.** Content
>   committed as `incomplete` may leave mandatory attributes absent and
>   `1..*` containers empty — for compositions, folders, and demographic
>   parties and relationships alike. Everything else is still checked: types,
>   terminology codes, patterns and archetype constraints, so content that is
>   *wrong* rather than merely *missing* is still rejected **422**. The
>   `EHR_STATUS` resource is the one exception: it does not accept the
>   `incomplete` state.

### Composition version history

`GET …/versioned_composition/{versioned_object_uid}` and its `revision_history`,
`version`, and `version/{version_uid}` sub-resources mirror the EHR_STATUS
history endpoints.

## DIRECTORY

The **DIRECTORY** is an optional `FOLDER` tree for organising compositions
within an EHR. The `/directory` endpoints manage the EHR's primary hierarchy
(the openEHR `EHR.directory`, which is always the first member of
`EHR.folders`).

An EHR can also index **additional folder hierarchies** beyond the directory:
commit further root `FOLDER`s through the CONTRIBUTION endpoint (the openEHR
REST API defines no dedicated endpoint for them). The EHR resource then lists
every live hierarchy in its `folders` attribute, in creation order, with
`directory` always equal to the first member; deleting the directory promotes
the next live hierarchy.

```shell
# Create the directory
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @folder.json \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/$EHR_ID/directory

# Read it (optionally at a time, or a sub-path)
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr \
  'http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/'$EHR_ID'/directory?path=episodes/2024'
```

- `POST /ehr/{ehr_id}/directory` — create the root folder; **201**.
- `PUT /ehr/{ehr_id}/directory` — update it; requires `If-Match`; **200**/**204**.
- `DELETE /ehr/{ehr_id}/directory` — logical delete; requires `If-Match`;
  **204**.
- `GET /ehr/{ehr_id}/directory` — the current folder tree, optionally filtered
  by `?version_at_time=` and `?path=` (slash-separated folder names). **204** if
  deleted at that time.
- `GET /ehr/{ehr_id}/directory/{version_uid}` — a specific version, optionally
  `?path=`.

## CONTRIBUTION

A **CONTRIBUTION** is an atomic change-set: a group of versioned-object changes
(compositions, statuses, folders) committed together with one shared audit. Use
it when several changes must land as a unit.

```shell
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @contribution.json \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/$EHR_ID/contribution
```

`POST /ehr/{ehr_id}/contribution` takes a contribution whose `versions` array
each describe a change (the RM object, its `change_type`, its `lifecycle_state`,
and per-version `commit_audit`) plus a shared `audit`. It returns **201** with
the contribution id in `ETag`, or **400**/**404**/**409**/**422** on invalid
input, unknown EHR, a uid conflict, or a change set that is well-formed but
cannot be followed.

Four things about the payload are worth calling out:

- **The shared `audit` must carry its own `change_type` and `committer`.** They
  are your account of the change set as a whole and are never derived or
  invented by the server — omitting either is a **422**. The server fills in
  `time_committed`, and `system_id` when you do not supply one.
- **`lifecycle_state` is required on every version** and is not defaulted.
  Omitting it is a **400**. The one exception is an attestation entry (see
  below), which commits no new version and therefore has no lifecycle state.
- **A version entry carries exactly the six declared members** —
  `preceding_version_uid`, `signature`, `lifecycle_state`, `attestations`,
  `data`, `commit_audit` — plus an optional `_type` self-tag. Anything else is
  refused **400** naming the offending key and its index, never silently
  ignored.
- **`other_input_version_uids` and `item` are not accepted on a commit.** Merge
  provenance is read-only (it appears on `ORIGINAL_VERSION` reads and is
  preserved when a version arrives through an EHR-Extract import or an archive
  load), and `item` is the shape of an imported version, which only the import
  route produces. Either one on a version entry is a **400**.

A `commit_audit` may instead be an **`ATTESTATION`** — set its `_type` to
`ATTESTATION` (or the wire form `UPDATE_ATTESTATION`) and add `reason`
(required) plus `is_pending` (required), and optionally `proof`, `items` and
`attested_view`. This is how content is committed already signed, or marked as
awaiting signature (`is_pending: true`). A coded `reason` must be a member of
the openEHR *attestation reason* group, and `items`, when present, must be
non-empty. The attestation is stored as part of that version's commit audit and
read back on the version envelope, in the revision history, and in exports. A
`description` may be a plain string, a `DV_TEXT`, or a `DV_CODED_TEXT` — a coded
description keeps its `defining_code`.

`GET /ehr/{ehr_id}/contribution/{contribution_uid}` returns **200** with the
contribution, or **404**. Add `Prefer: resolve_refs` to get full VERSION objects
instead of `OBJECT_REF`s (see
[Content negotiation & errors](content-negotiation.md#prefer-resolve_refs)).

`GET /ehr/{ehr_id}/contribution` (no uid) lists the EHR's contributions, newest
first — a FerroEHR extension (the openEHR REST API defines only the by-uid
read). Paginate with `?offset=` (default 0) and `?fetch=` (default 20, capped at
100). It returns **200** with a JSON summary, or **404** for an unknown EHR:

```json
{
  "rows": [
    {
      "uid": "…",
      "time_committed": "…",
      "committer": "…",
      "change_type": "251",
      "change_type_rubric": "amendment"
    }
  ],
  "total": 123
}
```

`committer` is the audit committer's *name* only — the by-uid read returns the
full `PARTY_PROXY`. `change_type` is the openEHR audit-change-type code and
`change_type_rubric` its display rubric from the same terminology the by-uid
read uses, so a client never maps codes locally. `total` counts **all** of the
EHR's contributions, not just the returned window.

> [!NOTE]
> The contribution envelope is **canonical JSON only** — openEHR publishes no
> CONTRIBUTION XML document, so an XML `Accept` on these routes is a **406** and
> an XML `Content-Type` a **415**. The FLAT and STRUCTURED formats, when used,
> apply only to the inner composition `data` of each version, never to the
> envelope.

## ITEM_TAG

**ITEM_TAG**s are small `key`/`value` annotations on a versioned object or on
one specific version, optionally pointing at a node inside the data through
`target_path`. They carry no clinical meaning and do not create a new version —
use them for workflow state, review flags, and integration bookkeeping.

```shell
# Every tag in an EHR, optionally filtered
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr \
  'http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/'$EHR_ID'/tags?tag_key=flag'

# Replace the tag list of one composition (container-wide, by object uuid)
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr -X PUT \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Prefer: return=representation' \
  --data-binary '[{"key":"flag","value":"follow-up"}]' \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/$EHR_ID/composition/$OBJECT_UUID/tags

# Delete every tag under one key
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr -X DELETE \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/ehr/$EHR_ID/composition/$OBJECT_UUID/tags/flag
```

- `GET /ehr/{ehr_id}/tags` — every tag in the EHR, whatever it targets. The
  optional `tag_key`, `tag_value` and `tag_target_path` filters are exact,
  case-sensitive, and AND-combined; an omitted filter constrains nothing. An EHR
  with no matching tag answers **200** with `[]`, never 404.
- `GET|PUT /ehr/{ehr_id}/composition/{uid_based_id}/tags` and the same pair
  under `…/ehr_status/{uid_based_id}/tags` — read or **replace** the addressed
  collection. The `PUT` body is a bare JSON array of tags (`key` required,
  `value` and `target_path` optional; `target` and `owner_id` come from the
  route, and a body that supplies them — or any other undeclared member — is a
  **400**). An empty array `[]` is the clear-all form, never an error. `PUT`
  answers **204** by default, **200** with the resulting list under
  `Prefer: return=representation`.
- `DELETE …/tags/{key}` — delete every tag under one key on the addressed
  collection; **204**.

Two properties shape how you address them:

- **The id you pass selects *which* collection.** A full version id
  (`OBJECT_VERSION_ID`) addresses that one version's tags; a bare object uuid
  (`HIER_OBJECT_ID`) addresses the versioned-object container's tags.
- **The two collections are disjoint.** A tag has exactly one target, so
  replacing the container's list never touches any version's list, and
  replacing one version's list never touches the container's or a sibling
  version's.

Every returned tag carries a server-assigned `target` (the bare uid of what it
tags) and `owner_id` (an `OBJECT_REF` to the owning EHR). Tags can also ride
along with a content write instead of taking a second round trip — see
[Item tags via headers](content-negotiation.md#item-tags-via-headers).

## Status-code summary

| Code | Meaning across these resources |
|---|---|
| 200 | Retrieved, or updated with `Prefer: return=representation` / `return=identifier`. |
| 201 | Created (EHR, composition, directory, contribution). |
| 204 | Success with no body (`return=minimal`), or deleted / deleted-at-time. |
| 400 | Malformed request, missing required header/parameter, an undeclared payload member, or already-deleted. |
| 404 | Unknown EHR, object, version, or no version at the requested time. |
| 405 | Method not allowed on this resource (always with an `Allow` header), or the resource is switched off by configuration. |
| 406 | The `Accept` header names no representation this resource has. |
| 409 | Conflict — duplicate subject/id, a version that is not the latest, or a content write to a deactivated (`is_modifiable = false`) EHR. |
| 412 | `If-Match` did not match the latest version (current id returned in `ETag`). |
| 415 | The request `Content-Type` names a format this resource cannot process. |
| 422 | Well-formed but unfollowable — failed template/semantic validation, an illegal version-lifecycle transition, or a change set the server cannot apply. |

The [Content negotiation & errors](content-negotiation.md) chapter covers the
error body shape and the headers referenced above in full.
