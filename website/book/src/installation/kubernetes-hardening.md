# Cluster hardening: what the chart does, and what you must

The [Kubernetes chapter](kubernetes.md) documents the chart. This section is the
other half: an audit of this deployment against the [OWASP Kubernetes Security
Cheat
Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Kubernetes_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html),
split by **who can actually apply each control**.

That split is the point. A workload chart controls its pod security context, its
resource bounds, its NetworkPolicy, its ServiceAccount and how it consumes
secrets. It cannot patch a node, set an API-server flag, configure etcd,
authenticate a kubelet, or install an admission controller. For those, the honest
deliverable is not a setting but a statement of **what you owe and what happens if
you do not** — because a deployment that inherits an unchecked assumption is not
secured by the chart's own hardening.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Several controls here are ones **no application-level hardening can compensate
> for**. If the kubelet accepts anonymous requests, or anything untrusted can read
> etcd, then every control this project ships — non-root, read-only rootfs, dropped

Claims about what the chart renders are checked against the chart's own render
gates. Claims about what a cluster then *applies* come from the deployment probe
harness, which reads each answer from the layer that actually decides it — the
container runtime's own spec for the security context, the API server for
admission, the EndpointSlice for readiness — and which declares in its own record
what it did **not** exercise, so silence is never read as coverage.

## Final thoughts: the three practices, checked

The cheat sheet closes with three practices rather than controls. Checking them
against what this project actually ships, rather than claiming them:

**"Embed security into the container lifecycle as early as possible" —
evidenced.** Security here is CI, not a review checklist: the chart's render gate
parses every rendered object and asserts the Restricted profile per container,
the golden renders pin the exact bytes, the secret-leak gate refuses a credential
that would reach a ConfigMap, the image scanners run at build and again on a
schedule against the published tags, `cargo deny` runs on every change, and
zizmor and CodeQL read the workflows themselves. Each of those refuses a merge
rather than filing a comment, and each of the chart-side ones has been watched to
fail deliberately — a gate nobody has seen fail is a gate nobody knows works.

**"Use Kubernetes-native controls to reduce operational risk" — evidenced.** The
chart's controls are the platform's own: a NetworkPolicy rather than an in-app
firewall, a security context and the Restricted profile rather than a hardening
sidecar, resource limits rather than in-process throttling alone, probes rather
than an external watchdog, a user namespace rather than a trusted UID, and
[no service mesh](hardening-network-policy.md#service-mesh-a-recorded-decision)
because what one would add is either already provided or not needed at this
shape. The one place we did *not* take a native control is Pod Security
Admission, and that is because [labelling a namespace is not a chart's
call](hardening-workload.md#pod-security-admission-complying-versus-being-refused) —
stated as the operator's rather than quietly skipped.

**"Leverage the context Kubernetes provides to prioritize remediation" — partly,
and here is the honest version.** The generic form of this practice is to rank
findings by whether the affected code is reachable in your deployment. This
project's answer is the **OpenVEX documents**: when a scanner reports advisories
in a privilege-dropping helper that opens no socket and parses no untrusted
input, the response is a machine-readable `not_affected` statement with a
controlled-vocabulary justification and an `impact_statement` a reader can
check — not a silenced ignore list, and not a rebuild that fixes nothing.

That mechanism has a cost, and stating it is what makes the claim honest: **a VEX
statement is a claim about today's binary, and it must be re-checked on every
base-image bump.** When upstream rebuilds that helper, statements about it become
obsolete, and a stale `not_affected` is worse than no VEX at all — it is an
argument that has quietly stopped being true while still suppressing its finding.
The scheduled scan is what surfaces a finding whose statement no longer matches,
and the re-check itself is a human obligation, not an automated one.
