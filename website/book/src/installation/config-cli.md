# CLI & production checklist

The binary's command-line surface, what a zero-configuration boot actually
gives you, the minimum a production deployment sets, and which material belongs
in a mounted file rather than an environment variable. Precedence, the
environment-name grammar, and file discovery are on the
[Configuration reference](configuration.md) index.

<!-- toc -->

## The command line

Two flags are global: they apply to the server and to every subcommand:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--config <path>` | The configuration file to load, overriding the search order. Fatal if missing or unreadable. |
| `--set <key>=<value>` | A dotted-path override, repeatable, highest precedence of all layers (e.g. `--set db.max_connections=40`). |

With no subcommand, the binary boots the server.

### `ferroehr config …`

```text
ferroehr config default             # print the annotated default ferroehr.toml
ferroehr config check [--config P]  # validate file + environment + --set
```

`config default` writes the fully-commented template every key's default comes
from, the starting point for a real `ferroehr.toml`.

`config check` runs the same validation the server runs at boot (the strict
unknown-key sweep, the type pass, the aggregated semantic rules, and the
"authentication enabled needs a mechanism" rule) and **touches no database**,
so it is safe in CI and before a rollout. It exits 0 when the configuration is
valid and 1 otherwise; on success it prints the effective configuration as TOML
with every secret redacted, and notes on stderr when `db.url` is still the
built-in development default.

### `ferroehr db …`

```text
ferroehr db migrate   # apply the embedded migrations and exit
ferroehr db verify    # verify, issuing no DDL, that the schema matches this build
```

These exist so a least-privilege deployment can separate the two database
identities: run `db migrate` once under a DSN that holds DDL rights (a
Kubernetes Job, an init container, a CI/CD stage), then boot the server with
[`db.migrate = "verify"`](config-server.md#db) under a DSN with no DDL rights at
all. See [Operations](../operations.md#applying-migrations).

### `ferroehr healthcheck`

Probes the running server's status endpoint and exits 0 on a 2xx, 1 otherwise:
the container `HEALTHCHECK` and the Kubernetes exec-probe fallback.

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FERROEHR_HEALTHCHECK_URL` | URL | `http://127.0.0.1:8080/ferroehr/rest/status` | The URL the subcommand probes; also settable as `--url`. Not part of `ferroehr.toml`. |

## Zero-config boot and the production checklist

With no file and no environment, the effective configuration is: listener
`0.0.0.0:8080` at the ITS-REST base path with Swagger UI; the database at the
built-in development DSN with migrations applied at boot; RBAC on; signing on in
`digest` mode with read-time verification strict; the audit trail on with only
the local store; rate limiting on; logs in `auto` format at `info`; **and every
integration off**.

One thing that configuration does *not* do is serve requests.
`auth.enabled` defaults to `true`, and **authentication enabled with no
mechanism configured is a boot error** rather than a running server that refuses
everything: RFC 9110 §11.6.1 requires a `401` challenge to name a scheme
applicable to the resource, and a server with no mechanism has none: it could
only refuse every request while advertising a scheme it does not implement. The
error names the three ways out: add `[[auth.basic.users]]`, add an `[auth.oidc]`
issuer, or set `auth.enabled = false` for development. So a bare `docker run` of
the image with no configuration stops at startup with that message, while the
downloadable Compose quickstart boots because it ships a user.

For production, set at least:

- **`db.url`:** the real DSN, via `FERROEHR__DB__URL` from a secret or a
  `url_file`-mounted value, never inline in a world-readable file. Leaving the
  development default in place is warned about loudly at every boot.
- **`db.migrate = "verify"`** with the schema applied out of band, so the
  serving role needs no DDL rights.
- **an authentication mechanism:** a Basic user store and/or `[auth.oidc]`.
- **`log.format = "json"`** for cluster log collectors.
- **`server.cors_permissive`** stays `false`; **`server.swagger_ui`** per
  posture.
- **`server.system_id`:** this deployment's own openEHR system identifier.
  Choose it before the first EHR is created: it is stored with every EHR, audit
  entry and version identifier, and changing it later never rewrites what is
  already committed.
- **`management.*`** per posture. A dedicated `management.port` is recommended
  so the introspection surface is never reachable on the clinical listener, and
  every endpoint stays `off` until you name a level for it.
- **TLS everywhere a transport supports it:** `server.tls` (or a
  TLS-terminating ingress), `audit.syslog.transport = "tls"`, `events.tls`,
  `fhir.outbound.tls`, HTTPS for the object store.
- **real secrets via the environment or a `*_file` sibling**, never inline.

## What belongs in a mounted file (versus the environment)

The environment cannot carry an array of tables, so the **Basic-auth user
store** (`[[auth.basic.users]]`) is file-only.

Genuinely file-shaped material (the **PGP signing key**, **Cedar policies**,
**ATNA and terminology-server PEMs**, a **JWKS blob**) is referenced by an
in-TOML `*_path` / `*_file` key pointing at a mounted path. On Kubernetes the
chart's `config.files` map materialises each entry under `/etc/ferroehr/`,
read-only, from a Secret.

Prefer a `*_file` sibling over the environment form for any secret in a
container: an environment value is readable through `/proc/<pid>/environ` and is
inherited by every child process the container spawns.

Everything else is a plain key you can set in the file or override with a
`FERROEHR_*` variable.

For a worked development example (the server section, CORS, admin, management
and the Basic-auth user store) read the configuration carried inline in the
quickstart `docker-compose.yml`; see [Docker Compose](compose.md).

## Variables outside the server's namespace

The PostgreSQL init container's variables are `PG_INIT_USER`, `PG_INIT_PASSWORD`
and `PG_INIT_DB`; they configure the database container, not the server, and
sit outside the server's reserved `FERROEHR_` namespace.

Inside that namespace, a handful of names are deliberately **not** configuration
keys and pass the strict sweep untouched: `FERROEHR_CONFIG` (the config-file
pointer), `FERROEHR_HEALTHCHECK_URL` (the container healthcheck), the
build-stamp variables, and the Compose parameterization (image tags, host ports,
CPU and memory limits). They keep a single `_` by design, which is exactly what
distinguishes them from configuration keys, and why a single-underscore
misspelling of a real key is reported at boot with the uniform spelling it
should have had.
