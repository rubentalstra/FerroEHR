# Configuration reference

FerroEHR is configured by **one file — `ferroehr.toml`** — whose sections cover
the entire server, with `FERROEHR_*` environment variables (and repeatable
`--set` flags) as per-key overrides on top. This page is the entry point: the
quickstart, how configuration loads and how environment names map onto the
file, the one key that selects the openEHR specification generation set, and a
map of which page documents which section.

<!-- toc -->

## Quickstart

Generate an annotated template, edit it, and run:

```bash
# Write a fully-commented ferroehr.toml with every key at its default.
ferroehr config default > ferroehr.toml

# Edit it — at minimum set db.url and an auth mechanism.
$EDITOR ferroehr.toml

# Validate without touching the database, then run.
ferroehr config check --config ferroehr.toml
ferroehr --config ferroehr.toml
```

A server started with **no file and no environment** still boots, with one
exception you will hit immediately: authentication is on by default and a
server with no mechanism configured refuses to start. See
[Zero-config boot and the production checklist](config-cli.md#zero-config-boot-and-the-production-checklist).

## How configuration loads

Configuration is assembled once at boot from four layers, lowest precedence to
highest:

1. **Built-in defaults** — the values in the tables on the section pages.
2. **The config file** — `ferroehr.toml` (see [file discovery](#file-discovery)).
3. **`FERROEHR_*` environment variables** — override individual keys.
4. **`--set key=value` CLI flags** (repeatable) — win over everything.

Two permanent conventional aliases sit *below* their `FERROEHR_` forms within
layer 3: `DATABASE_URL` → `db.url` and `RUST_LOG` → `log.filter`. Nothing else
has a non-`FERROEHR_` name.

### The environment-variable mapping

Every key has one mechanical environment spelling: **`FERROEHR` + the TOML
path, upper-cased, with a double underscore (`__`) between every segment —
including after the `FERROEHR` prefix.** A single underscore only ever appears
*inside* a key word.

| TOML | Environment variable |
|---|---|
| `[db] max_connections = 20` | `FERROEHR__DB__MAX_CONNECTIONS=20` |
| `[auth.oidc] issuer = "…"` | `FERROEHR__AUTH__OIDC__ISSUER=…` |
| `[management.endpoints] env = "off"` | `FERROEHR__MANAGEMENT__ENDPOINTS__ENV=off` |
| `[terminology.external.providers.default] url = "…"` | `FERROEHR__TERMINOLOGY__EXTERNAL__PROVIDERS__DEFAULT__URL=…` |

Scalars are typed automatically (bool / int / float, else string).
**List-typed keys take comma-separated values**
(`FERROEHR__AUTH__OIDC__AUDIENCES=ferroehr,other`). Map-keyed tables are
reachable too — the map key is just another segment
(`FERROEHR__SUBJECT_PROXY__SYSTEMS__PAS__BASE_URL`). Arrays of tables — the
Basic-auth user store — are **file-only**, because the environment grammar has
no way to spell an array index.

> [!NOTE]
> Enum values are lowercase / `snake_case` tokens, exactly as the tables show.
> Secret-typed keys are redacted everywhere the configuration is rendered (the
> `/management/env` snapshot, `ferroehr config check`, logs), and each has a
> `*_file` sibling that reads the value from a file, for Kubernetes and Docker
> secret mounts. Setting a secret and its `*_file` sibling at once is a boot
> error.

### File discovery

The first of these that exists is loaded (later layers still override its
values):

1. `--config <path>`,
2. `FERROEHR_CONFIG=<path>`,
3. `./ferroehr.toml` (current directory),
4. `/etc/ferroehr/ferroehr.toml`.

An explicitly pointed-at file (1–2) is fatal if absent; the search-order files
(3–4) are simply skipped when absent — but fatal if present and unreadable or
unparseable.

### Strict validation

Configuration is validated at boot (and by `ferroehr config check`), and the
server refuses to start on any error:

- **Unknown keys are rejected** — in the file, with the offending line number
  and a did-you-mean suggestion, and in the `FERROEHR_` environment namespace.
  A variable in that namespace that is neither a known section nor one of the
  reserved non-configuration names is a boot error, so a misspelled security
  key can never be silently ignored. A single-underscore near miss
  (`FERROEHR_DB_URL`) is reported with the exact uniform spelling it should
  have had.
- **Type errors are boot errors**, naming the key and what was expected.
- **Semantic errors are aggregated** — one pass reports every problem at once,
  so a broken configuration is fixed in a single iteration.

## `spec_profile`

```toml
# The openEHR specification generation set the server runs.
spec_profile = "development"   # or "stable"
```

openEHR publishes released specification versions and keeps developing the
next ones. FerroEHR generates **both**, and this key decides which set the
running server serves.

| Value | RM | BASE | LANG | Choose it when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `development` *(default)* | 1.2.0 | 1.3.0 | 1.1.0 | You want the generations this build is developed against. This is the default for every deployment that does not set the key. |
| `stable` | 1.1.0 | 1.2.0 | 1.0.0 | Your governance requires running on released openEHR specifications only. |

Environment form: `FERROEHR__SPEC_PROFILE=stable`. The key is a top-level
scalar, not a section — there is no `[spec_profile]` table.

### Why it is one key and not three

The components' generations are modelled against each other, not
independently: RM 1.1.0's own machine-readable model declares that it includes
BASE 1.2.0. Letting you pick RM 1.1.0 with BASE 1.3.0 would offer a
combination openEHR never published, so the profile is a single coupled choice
and incoherent sets are unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged.

### Seeing which profile is active

The profile is reported in two places, so it is never a guess:

- the **boot banner**, on every start, alongside the RM version it serves;
- **`GET /management/info`**, which names the active profile with the RM and
  BASE generations it selects, next to the build provenance.

### What changes on the wire

The profile is an **acceptance boundary**, and it is exact in both directions.

Under `stable`, a query that addresses specification surface the released
generations do not define is **refused with a typed error naming the active
profile** — an AQL `FROM` class or a path attribute RM 1.1.0 does not declare
is rejected at planning time rather than answered as though it existed.

Released surface the development line later dropped **stays accepted** under
`stable`, which is the half most implementations get wrong. A demographic
party carrying the RM 1.1.0 `PARTY.reverse_relationships` attribute is read
and accepted under `stable`; `development` refuses it as an undeclared key,
because RM 1.2.0 removed it. The attribute is derived data the server
recomputes from `relationships`, so the copy you send is validated and then
dropped rather than stored.

Reading a stored object is bounded the same way. Every commit records whether
the released generations can express the body it accepted, and under `stable`
a stored version they cannot is **refused with `409 Conflict`** naming the
active profile, the version, and the remedy — never served under a generation
set that does not define it, and never rewritten to fit one. Under
`development` the same object reads normally. This is FerroEHR's own
extension: no openEHR specification governs runtime version selection, so the
status follows HTTP itself (RFC 9110 §15.5.10 — a conflict with the current
state of the target resource, whose resolution the response describes).

**Queries take the same refusal wherever they serve a version body.** AQL is
gated in two places, and they answer different questions. At *planning* time the
query text is checked: a `FROM` class or path attribute the released generations
do not declare is rejected. At *result assembly* the projection is checked: a
whole-object projection — `SELECT c FROM EHR e CONTAINS COMPOSITION c` — returns
stored version bodies, so if any row of the page comes from a version the
released generations cannot express, the whole query answers `409 Conflict`
naming that version. The row is never quietly dropped from the result set
instead: a `RESULT_SET` is columns and rows of values with nowhere to explain a
missing row, so silently eliding one would be an answer you could not tell from
"no such data".

A **leaf projection** over the very same rows — `SELECT c/name/value FROM EHR e
CONTAINS COMPOSITION c` — still answers `200`. It serves data values rather than
version bodies, over paths the planning gate has already bounded to the released
generation's declared surface. That is the honest boundary: the profile is an
acceptance boundary on what is served as an openEHR object, not a content filter
over the values inside one.

Under `development` none of this applies and it costs nothing — the assembly
gate returns before it touches the database.

The exact additive delta between the two generation sets is pinned in the
build, so a future openEHR re-vendoring cannot silently widen or narrow what a
profile accepts.

### Changing the profile on an existing deployment

Treat the profile as a deployment commitment. Both directions are defined, but
they are not symmetric:

| Direction | Supported? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `stable` → `development` | **Always safe** | openEHR minor releases are additive by the Foundation's own release strategy, so every object stored under the released generations is valid under the development ones. |
| `development` → `stable` | **Only for data that never used a development-only construct** | There is no down-conversion. An object that did use one becomes unreadable — `409`, not a silently degraded body — until you switch back. |

If you need to stay on released specifications, choose `stable` on day one
rather than migrating into it later. Silently rewriting stored clinical
content to fit an older generation would be data loss disguised as a setting,
so no tool does it.

Objects committed before this stamp existed, and objects written by the
verbatim-replay paths (EHR-Extract import, archive load), carry no recorded
answer; they are assessed at read instead, which costs one extra parse per
read of such an object and only under `stable`. Nothing is written back — a
read stays a read.
