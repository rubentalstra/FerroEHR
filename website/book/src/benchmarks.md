# Benchmarks

FerroEHR measures performance with the **same instrument family that measures
conformance**: the built-in CNF runner. There is no separate benchmark harness:
every published number is measured by a committed, re-runnable instrument,
reported in both directions, and regenerated from committed artefacts. There is no
chart in this project that you cannot regenerate yourself with one command.

## The three instruments

- **Measured class runs** (`CONF_PERF_CLASS=… bash scripts/conformance.sh`, or the
  runner's `perf` subcommand): conformance by measurement. The open-loop
  hospital-simulation workload holds a population-anchored offered-load floor for
  the normative hour (or an extended hold up to twelve hours), and the volumetric
  deployment class is **earned or not** from the committed record. Every
  measurement embeds re-checkable HDR histograms and per-container resource
  telemetry. See [Performance](performance.md).
- **The step-load stress ladder** (the `stress` subcommand): exploration. The
  same workload at geometrically climbing rates until the system leaves the
  envelope, then bisection to the **maximum sustainable throughput** (the knee of
  the latency-throughput curve). Each rung embeds its own histograms and resource
  telemetry; a rung where the load *generator* fell behind is flagged
  generator-bound, never counted against the server. A stress report earns no
  class and never touches the conformance record.
- **The AQL probe** (the `aql-probe` subcommand): diagnosis. The instrument's AQL
  set fired repeatedly against a freshly seeded corpus, with wire-latency
  percentiles and the database-side cost attributed per SQL statement. The
  optimization loop's entry point; exploration evidence only.

## What the workload simulates

All three instruments drive the same **hospital simulation**: clinical journeys
(admissions, shift vitals, medication rounds, laboratory results arriving
asynchronously, chart reviews, AQL ward dashboards, corrections, discharges)
expanded from a committed journey catalogue onto an open-loop arrival schedule,
with payloads built from **official openEHR CKM templates** vendored with
provenance. Every stage is its own planned arrival instant, so latency is measured
from the *planned* time (coordinated-omission-corrected) and a stalled server
cannot hide. The full workload story lives in
[Performance](performance.md#the-hospital-simulation).

## Running the instruments

```bash
# the measured class run (the conformance pipeline's perf stage)
CONF_PERF_CLASS=POC bash scripts/conformance.sh

# the step-load stress ladder (fresh compose + seed, then the climb)
cnf-runner stress --root <catalogue-root> --ixit <ixit.json> --out <stress.json>

# the AQL optimization probe
cnf-runner aql-probe --root <catalogue-root> --ixit <ixit.json> --out <aql-probe.json>
```

Every instrument seeds a freshly composed, empty server through the public API and
the stack is torn down afterwards; there is no seed reuse, so no run ever
measures another run's leftovers. Committed records land under
`docs/conformance/<sut-name>/`; the published charts regenerate from them
(`scripts/render/perf-assets.sh` for one system,
`scripts/render/comparison.sh` for the cross-system overlay, which calls the
runner's `stress-compare` renderer) and are diff-guarded in CI.

## Fairness rules

The comparison methodology is enforced by construction:

- **The same runner drives both servers** against the same committed catalogue and
  the same ladder, each on its own freshly composed stack with its own committed
  party statement.
- **Payload skeletons are byte-identical:** both servers receive exactly the same
  bytes for the same journey stage.
- **Database maintenance is settled deterministically before every measured
  window**, by the same procedure on both sides, so neither run pays the other's
  maintenance debt or trips an autovacuum mid-measurement.
- **Rate limiting is off for measurement runs** on the side that has it, because
  the instruments deliberately offer load past the knee; both instruments refuse
  to write a record if the server answered any throttled request.
- **Configuration differences are explicit and labelled**, never quiet. Version
  signing is the clearest case: it is a FerroEHR extension EHRbase does not
  perform, so it is switched off through its documented toggle for throughput
  comparisons and the record says so. Any other setting raised or lowered for
  parity is likewise a visible part of the composed posture, which is why the
  postures live in committed compose files rather than in a shell variable
  someone may or may not have exported.
- **Both directions publish on equal footing.** Where EHRbase sustains more, its
  curve says so exactly like the reverse; see [Comparison](comparison.md).
