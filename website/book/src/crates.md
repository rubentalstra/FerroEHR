# Rust crates

FerroEHR's openEHR specification layer is published on crates.io as eight
standalone Rust crates, usable without the CDR. They are the same crates the
server itself is built on: the spec types are generated deterministically from
the official openEHR machine-readable artifacts (BMM/XSD/OpenAPI), and the
engines (ADL, AQL, serialization runtimes) are hand-written against the
vendored specification text.

| Crate | Implements | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| [`openehr-base`](https://crates.io/crates/openehr-base) | BASE 1.2.0 + 1.3.0 | Foundation + base types (identification, intervals, ISO-8601 types) |
| [`openehr-rm`](https://crates.io/crates/openehr-rm) | RM 1.1.0 + 1.2.0 | The Reference Model: `COMPOSITION`, data structures/types, change control, generated invariant validation, the static RM attribute model |
| [`openehr-am`](https://crates.io/crates/openehr-am) | AM 1.4.0 + 2.4.0 | The Archetype Object Model, both majors side by side |
| [`openehr-adl`](https://crates.io/crates/openehr-adl) | ADL 2.4.0 | ADL2/cADL/ODIN parser, AOM2 validation, flattener, OPT2, ADL 1.4→2 conversion |
| [`openehr-term`](https://crates.io/crates/openehr-term) | TERM 3.1.0 | Terminology model + the embedded official openEHR terminology (five languages: `en`, `es`, `ja`, `pt`, `zh`) |
| [`openehr-lang`](https://crates.io/crates/openehr-lang) | LANG 1.0.0 + 1.1.0 | The BMM meta-model and its P_BMM schema form, plus hand-written ODIN, BEL and Expression-Language readers |
| [`openehr-query`](https://crates.io/crates/openehr-query) | QUERY 1.1.0 | AQL lexer, parser, typed AST, and canonical printer |
| [`openehr-its`](https://crates.io/crates/openehr-its) | ITS-JSON, ITS-XML, ITS-REST 1.1.0 | Canonical JSON + XML codecs, the generated ITS-REST contract, OPT 1.4, Simplified Formats (FLAT/STRUCTURED/Web Template) |

```toml
[dependencies]
openehr-rm = "0.0.64"
openehr-its = "0.0.64"
```

All eight are **edition 2024** with an MSRV of **Rust 1.97**, and all eight
inherit the workspace lint table, including `unsafe_code = "forbid"`, which no
attribute anywhere in the crate can relax. There is no `unsafe` block in the
published specification layer.

## Generations: reaching more than one specification version

A crate generated from more than one openEHR generation exposes each as a
**version-named module**: `openehr_rm::v1_1` and `openehr_rm::v1_2`,
`openehr_base::v1_2` / `v1_3`, `openehr_am::v1_4` / `v2_4`,
`openehr_lang::v1_0` / `v1_1`, `openehr_term::v3_1`. The crate's `prelude`
re-exports the **current** generation, so ordinary code needs no module path;
an older generation is reached by naming its module in full:

```rust,no_run
// The current generation (RM 1.2.0), via the crate prelude:
use openehr_rm::prelude::Composition;

// The released generation (RM 1.1.0), via its own module path. Import
// renaming is not used anywhere in this project; where both generations
// appear in one file, give one of them a type alias:
type Rm110Composition = openehr_rm::v1_1::composition::composition::Composition;
```

Each generation mirrors its specification's own package structure, so the path
after the generation module reads the same in both. Every generation module
also carries its own `prelude`; no name from one generation is ever mixed into
another.

`openehr-lang` is the one crate whose generations also differ in *what they
contain*, because upstream publishes two BMM meta-models side by side. Its
`v1_1` generation carries them as sibling specification units: the stable,
tool-implemented BMM v2.x model (`bmm`, its persistence form
`bmm_persistence`, and the `beom` expression model) is on the generation's
prelude, while the paused BMM3 model (`bmm3`) is reachable only by full module
path. They cannot be merged (a set of class names, `BmmClass`, `BmmModel` and
`BmmPackage` among them, occurs in both units with materially different
shapes) so the prelude carries the stable units and the choice stays explicit
at the use site. The older `v1_0` generation is what its release actually
defines: the BMM model plus an ODIN reader, with no BEL or Expression-Language
notation.

## Versioning

The package version is the crates' **own independent SemVer line**: it tracks
this implementation's code and moves freely with fixes and improvements, never
with the vendored openEHR specification versions. While the line is `0.0.x`,
expect breaking changes between releases, which always ship in lockstep across
all eight crates.

The implemented specification version is therefore a **separate datum, per
generation**. Each generated crate emits a `Generation` enum that is the only
authority for it: one variant per generation module, `Default` marking the
current one, each variant carrying its specification version as a `const fn`,
and `Display`/`FromStr` round-tripping the module token:

```rust,no_run
assert_eq!(openehr_rm::Generation::default().spec_version(), "1.2.0");
assert_eq!(openehr_rm::Generation::V1_1.spec_version(), "1.1.0");
assert_eq!(openehr_rm::Generation::default().as_str(), "v1_2");
```

There is deliberately **no crate-level `SPEC_VERSION` constant in the generated
crates**: a single constant would contradict a caller using a non-current
generation. Exactly three crates implement one specification each and do expose
one: `openehr_its::SPEC_VERSION`, `openehr_query::SPEC_VERSION`,
`openehr_adl::SPEC_VERSION`.

## Taking only the part of `openehr-its` you need

`openehr-its` layers its features so a browser or embedded consumer does not
have to compile an HTTP server to read a template. The parsing spine is
`json` → `xml` → `opt14` → `flat`, each pulling in the one below it. Three
layers sit beside the spine and are declined independently: `cache` (the
async WebTemplate cache, the crate's only `moka` user), `schema-validation`
(validation against the compiled-in ITS-JSON RM schema, its only `jsonschema`
user) and `rest-server` (the generated ITS-REST contract and its response
runtime, which is what brings in `axum`). The default feature `full` is all
seven, so an existing dependency line keeps the crate it had.

`flat` and `opt14` build for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, so a browser consumer
can call `flat::build_web_template` or read an OPT 1.4 template:

```toml
[dependencies]
openehr-its = { version = "0.0.64", default-features = false, features = ["flat"] }
```

With `default-features = false` and no feature at all, the crate compiles to
the SMART App Launch scope grammar alone: std-only, with no dependency of any
kind, so a REST client can parse scope strings with the grammar the CDR
enforces instead of carrying a second one.

## Releases

The eight crates publish as the last leg of the release pipeline, gated on a
human: the leg runs in a protected environment with a required reviewer, so
the run pauses there and nothing reaches crates.io without an explicit
approval. A separate dispatch lane covers a publish between releases and the
recovery path when the release leg fails.

Both lanes authenticate with **crates.io Trusted Publishing** (OIDC, no
long-lived token anywhere) and publish the crates **one at a time in
dependency order**, treating "already exists on the index" as done, so a run
interrupted halfway can be re-run to finish the set. The lane then reads the
registry back and refuses to report success unless all eight resolve at the
same version, because while the line is `0.0.x` a straggler makes its
siblings' internal requirements unresolvable for every consumer.

## Licensing

The eight crates fall into two groups.

The five generated model crates (`openehr-base`, `openehr-rm`, `openehr-am`,
`openehr-lang`, `openehr-term`) are **`Apache-2.0`**, the licence of the openEHR
machine-readable artifacts they are generated from, so any Rust project can use
them, in proprietary and hosted products included. They embed material derived
from those artifacts (generated types carrying specification documentation
text), which is Apache-2.0 as well, and their generated files name the openEHR
Foundation as a second copyright holder.

The three hand-written engines are under the **Business Source License 1.1**,
the licence of the FerroEHR application (each ships its `LICENSE` with the
parameters): `openehr-query` and `openehr-adl` declare **`BUSL-1.1`** and ship
only their own Rust sources, the README and that text; `openehr-its` declares
**`BUSL-1.1 AND Apache-2.0`**, because its generated codecs and REST contract
derive from the Apache-2.0 openEHR XSD, OpenAPI and BMM artifacts and it
packages the vendored ITS-JSON schema as bytes, so it ships both texts and its
README carries that file's attribution (upstream repository, the exact vendored
commit, and the licence) inside the package, where it travels with any
redistribution. Non-production use of these three is free, production use is
free for Non-Commercial Purposes, and any other production use, hosting for
third parties or distribution for a fee needs a commercial licence, exactly as
for the application.

`openehr-term` carries a third term, because it embeds a different kind of
openEHR material: the official terminology XML (the five language bundles, the
external-terminology index, and the property/unit data) is **CC-BY-SA 3.0**,
redistributed verbatim with attribution. Its manifest declares
**`Apache-2.0 AND CC-BY-SA-3.0`** and the package ships both license texts, so the declaration a consumer reads names every license the
crate's own bytes are under. If you redistribute the crate, the terminology data
travels under CC-BY-SA 3.0.

Versions 0.0.56 and earlier were published under the MIT terms in force at the
time (MIT AND Apache-2.0 for the crates that embed openEHR material) and keep
them; 0.0.57 was never published; 0.0.58 and 0.0.59 are Apache-2.0 for all
eight; from 0.0.60 the three engines are BUSL-1.1 as stated above. Published
versions keep the licence they were published with. The full picture, including
the vendored material that never reaches a published package, is in
[Licensing](licensing.md).
