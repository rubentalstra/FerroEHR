# Templates & validation

A template is what tells FerroEHR what clinical data to accept. Before you can
commit a composition, you upload the **Operational Template (OPT)** it conforms
to; from that template the server derives everything it needs to validate
incoming data and to describe the data's shape to client applications. This
chapter covers uploading and retrieving templates in both ADL generations, the
derived WebTemplate, the convenience FLAT and STRUCTURED composition formats, and
how validation behaves on commit. If templates and archetypes are new to you,
read the [openEHR primer](concepts/openehr-primer.md) first.

## Uploading an OPT 1.4 template

FerroEHR ingests templates in the **OPT 1.4** XML format. Upload one with
`Content-Type: application/xml`:

```shell
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr -i \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' \
  --data-binary @vital_signs.opt \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/template/adl1.4
```

The upload takes OPT XML and nothing else: a request declaring another payload
type (`Content-Type: application/json`, say) is refused with **415 Unsupported
Media Type** before the template is parsed. `text/xml` works the same as
`application/xml`, and omitting the header altogether is fine — the endpoint has
only one body format.

A successful upload returns **201 Created** with the id in `ETag` and
`Location`. Add `Prefer: return=identifier` when you only need the id back — the
response body is then the JSON identifier object:

```json
{ "template_id": "vital_signs" }
```

(`return=representation` returns the stored OPT XML; the default is an empty
body.) Uploading a template whose id already exists returns **409 Conflict** —
templates are immutable once loaded. Template ids are compared
**case-insensitively** (the stored casing is preserved), so uploading a
case-variant of an existing id — `Vital_Signs` against a stored `vital_signs` —
is also a **409 Conflict**, not a second template.

### What "invalid template" means, and which status you get

The upload runs two distinct gates, and they answer differently:

- **A payload that is not well-formed XML is a 400 Bad Request** — the server
  could not read it as XML at all.
- **A well-formed document that is not a valid operational template is a 422
  Unprocessable Entity.** This covers both the structural check (foreign or
  duplicated top-level elements, a decoded OPT with an empty `template_id` or
  `concept`) and the full archetype-model artefact-validity catalogue:
  reference-model conformance of every constrained type and attribute,
  occurrence/cardinality consistency, terminology code definedness and language
  consistency, archetype-identifier well-formedness, and constraint pattern
  validity (temporal and duration patterns, boolean satisfiability, assumed
  values inside their own constraints). The response body lists the offending
  archetype-model rule codes (`VCARM`, `VATID`, `VCORM`, `Pattern_validity`, …)
  in `validationErrors`, each with a human-readable detail.

The 422 gate also validates the template's **own meta-data** against the RM
resource-package invariants: the template's `language` (and every description
detail's) must be in the openEHR `languages` code set, `is_controlled` must
agree with the presence of a `revision_history`, and a `description` needs a
non-empty `original_author`, `lifecycle_state`, and at least one detail with a
non-empty `purpose`, with details keyed by distinct languages. Those refusals
carry the RM invariant name (for example
`RESOURCE_DESCRIPTION.Lifecycle_state_valid`) in `validationErrors`. ADL 1.4
archetype source uploads enforce the same family; there, an empty
`purpose`/`use`/`misuse` string is reported as a named warning rather than
refused, because the empty string is how real-world 1.4 authoring spells
absence.

## Uploading ADL 2 artefacts

ADL 2 artefacts — archetypes, templates and operational templates — are accepted
as `text/plain` source on `…/definition/template/adl2` and validated by the full
ADL 2 engine: the source is parsed, then checked against the AOM2 validity
catalogue (phase-1 basic integrity, reference-model conformance, and — for a
specialised artefact whose parent is already loaded — specialisation
conformance).

The two failure modes are again distinguished by status:

- **A source that does not parse is a 400 Bad Request**, carrying the ADL syntax
  (`S`-prefixed) error codes.
- **A source that parses but fails validation is a 422 Unprocessable Entity**,
  whose `validationErrors` list the AOM2 validity (`V`-prefixed) rule codes —
  `VARD`, `VCORM`, `VACSD` and friends.

A duplicate artefact id returns **409 Conflict**.

A loaded ADL 2 template is retrieved in either of two representations, chosen by
`Accept`: the stored ADL 2 **source** (`text/plain`, the default) or the
**operational template as JSON** (`application/json`). `Accept: application/xml`
has no declared body here and is a **406**. A partial `template_id` resolves to
the latest matching version, and a separate route addresses a version
explicitly:

```shell
# The ADL 2 source, verbatim
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr -H 'Accept: text/plain' \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/template/adl2/openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.t_vitals.v1.0.0

# The operational template as JSON, latest version matching the partial id
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/template/adl2/openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.t_vitals.v1

# Resolved inside one SemVer version (exact, or a `{major}` / `{major}.{minor}` prefix)
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr -H 'Accept: text/plain' \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/template/adl2/openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.t_vitals/1.0
```

## Listing templates

```shell
# List all templates
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/template/adl1.4

# Filter and page the list
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr \
  'http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/template/adl1.4?template_id=vital*&offset=0&fetch=20'

# Get the canonical OPT XML for one template
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr -H 'Accept: application/xml' \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/template/adl1.4/vital_signs
```

Both list endpoints — ADL 1.4 and ADL 2 — accept the same three filters
(`template_id`, `concept`, and `version`, each a glob pattern with `*` wildcards)
plus `offset` (rows to skip, default 0) and `fetch` (maximum rows; absent or 0 =
all). The filters AND together. An offset past the end of the match set is an
empty list, not an error.

> [!NOTE]
> When the `version` parameter is absent, the list collapses to the **latest
> version** of each template (the highest `.vN` axis of its `template_id`). Pass
> `version=*` to list every stored version, or a partial glob (`version=*.v1*`)
> to select specific ones.

## Deleting a template

Deletes are deliberately not part of the openEHR definition API, and FerroEHR
keeps them off the provisioning routes:

- an **OPT 1.4** template is removed with `DELETE /admin/template/{template_id}`,
  behind the admin gate (see
  [Admin & messaging APIs](operations-admin-apis.md));
- an **ADL 2** artefact is removed with
  `DELETE /definition/artefact/adl2/{artefact_id}`.

Both refuse with **409 Conflict** while any committed version still references
the template, and the message names how many versions still hold the reference —
a physical delete can never orphan committed clinical data. The count spans
archived content too, so an archived composition's template cannot be deleted out
from under it. Delete the compositions first.

## Archetype sources (a FerroEHR extension)

Beyond operational templates, FerroEHR can also hold the **source archetypes**
they were built from, so a deployment can keep its definition material in one
place:

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET|POST /definition/archetype/adl1.4` | List the stored ADL 1.4 archetype ids; upload one as `text/plain` ADL source |
| `GET|DELETE /definition/archetype/adl1.4/{archetype_id}` | Retrieve the stored source verbatim; remove it |
| `GET /definition/archetype/adl2`, `…/adl2/count` | List the stored ADL 2 archetypes, and count them |
| `GET /definition/artefact/adl2`, `…/adl2/count` | List and count *all* stored ADL 2 artefacts (archetypes, templates, OPTs) |
| `DELETE /definition/artefact/adl2/{artefact_id}` | Remove one ADL 2 artefact |

Properties worth knowing before you build on these:

- **They are our own design.** The openEHR REST API provisions operational
  templates only — it declares no archetype resource, no count, and no delete.
  These routes realize the openEHR *service model*'s archetype operations, which
  the released wire never surfaced, so they are excluded from openEHR wire
  conformance and never gate a conformance profile tier.
- **The archetype id is the client's, never assigned.** An ADL 1.4 upload reads
  it out of the source's own `archetype` header, and a re-upload of the same id
  **replaces** it (there is no conflict branch — the service operation is
  replace-or-create). Success is **201** with the id in the body and a
  `Location`.
- **Ids match case-insensitively**, and a malformed id on a read is simply a
  **404** — nothing is stored under it.
- **Writes respect the read-only role.** A principal carrying the configured
  read-only role is refused **403** before the store is touched. Uploads that do
  not parse or fail the phase-1 validity catalogue are **422**.

## The WebTemplate

The **WebTemplate** is a JSON description of a template that is far easier for
application code to consume than raw OPT XML — it lists every field with its
path, type, cardinality, allowed values, and labels, which is exactly what you
need to render a form or map data. Request it with the WebTemplate media type:

```shell
curl -u ferroehr:ferroehr \
  -H 'Accept: application/openehr.wt+json' \
  http://localhost:8080/ferroehr/rest/openehr/v1/definition/template/adl1.4/vital_signs
```

The WebTemplate is part of openEHR's own **Simplified Formats**
sub-specification of ITS-REST 1.1.0, and FerroEHR emits its metadata format
version `2.3` as that specification defines it — so tooling written against the
standard model works unchanged.

`Accept: application/json` on the same URL returns that identical WebTemplate
document — it is the only JSON representation of a template — but labelled
`Content-Type: application/json`, the type you asked for. Use
`Accept: application/xml` for the canonical OPT instead.

You can also fetch an **example composition** for a template — a skeleton
instance you can fill in — from
`GET /definition/template/adl1.4/{template_id}/example`. The same endpoint exists
for ADL 2 templates at `GET /definition/template/adl2/{template_id}/example`: the
stored operational template is turned into a WebTemplate and walked into an
example composition. Both serve any of canonical JSON/XML, FLAT, or STRUCTURED
(via `Accept`) and take the same two query parameters — `type`
(`input`/`output`) and `detail_level` (`required`/`medium`/`complete`).

## Composition formats

When committing or retrieving a composition, the canonical openEHR JSON (or XML)
is always available, but two flatter formats are offered for convenience, keyed
to a template:

- **FLAT (simSDT)** — `application/openehr.wt.flat+json`. The whole composition
  as a single flat map of `path|attribute → value`, which is compact and easy to
  produce from a form. For example:

  ```json
  {
    "vital_signs/blood_pressure/any_event:0/systolic|magnitude": 120,
    "vital_signs/blood_pressure/any_event:0/systolic|unit": "mm[Hg]",
    "vital_signs/blood_pressure/any_event:0/diastolic|magnitude": 80,
    "vital_signs/blood_pressure/any_event:0/diastolic|unit": "mm[Hg]",
    "vital_signs/language|code": "en",
    "vital_signs/language|terminology": "ISO_639-1"
  }
  ```

- **STRUCTURED (structSDT)** — `application/openehr.wt.structured+json`. The
  same data as a nested JSON tree that mirrors the template structure, rather
  than a flat map.

Send the matching `Content-Type` when committing, or the matching `Accept` when
retrieving, and the server converts between the flat/structured form and the
canonical composition. Both are defined by openEHR's **Simplified Formats**
sub-specification of ITS-REST 1.1.0 — that specification text is the only
authority the server follows here, and there is no vendor-compatibility mode. The
canonical JSON and XML remain the full-fidelity wire format. They work against
both ADL 1.4 and ADL 2 templates: a FLAT or STRUCTURED commit keyed to an
ADL 2-registered template resolves and is validated against that template's
archetype constraints exactly as an ADL 1.4 commit is.

> [!NOTE]
> The FLAT and STRUCTURED formats are always relative to a template — the paths
> are template paths, and the target template comes from the
> `openehr-template-id` request header, without which a commit is a **422**. Use
> them for form-driven capture; use canonical JSON/XML for full-fidelity
> exchange and archival.

### Optional RM attributes (`_`-prefixed keys)

Beyond the template's own fields, FLAT and STRUCTURED carry the optional
reference-model attributes as `_`-prefixed path segments, round-tripping in both
directions. Indexed families take an `:n` suffix; sub-fields ride the usual
`|attribute` pipes:

```json
{
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/_uid": "9fcc1c70-…",
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/_link:0|type": "problem",
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/_link:0|target": "ehr://…",
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/any_event:0/systolic/_null_flavour|code": "253",
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/any_event:0/systolic/_normal_range/lower|magnitude": 90,
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/_other_participation:0|function": "witness",
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/_other_participation:0|name": "Dr. Marcus Johnson"
}
```

Which families apply depends on the node they hang off:

| Host | Families |
|---|---|
| Any locatable node | `_uid`, `_link:n`, `_feeder_audit` |
| Any entry (observation, evaluation, instruction, action, admin entry) | `_work_flow_id`, `_guideline_id`, `_provider`, `_other_participation:n` |
| An instruction | `_expiry_time`, `_wf_definition` |
| An action | `_instruction_details`, and `_reason:n` on its state transition |
| An element | `_null_flavour`, `_null_reason` |
| A data value | `_mapping:n`, `_normal_range`, `_other_reference_ranges:n`, `_accuracy`, `_language`, `_encoding`, `_charset`, `_thumbnail` |
| Any party reference (a provider, a participation, the subject) | `_identifier:n` |
| The composition's event context | `_health_care_facility`, `_participation:n` |

An ACTION's `_instruction_details` carries exactly three suffixes on the field
itself — the instruction's path within its composition, that composition's uid,
and the activity id:

```json
{
  "encounter/procedure/_instruction_details|path": "/content[openEHR-EHR-INSTRUCTION.request.v1]",
  "encounter/procedure/_instruction_details|composition_uid": "4cdc3017-d8c5-4cd3-9900-f3bb7171d006",
  "encounter/procedure/_instruction_details|activity_id": "activities[at0001]"
}
```

An interval event additionally carries `|sample_count` (the number of samples the
interval summarises) alongside its `/width` and `/math_function` fields.

An element that records *why* a value is missing carries `_null_flavour` (and
optionally `_null_reason`) **instead of** a value — the reference model makes the
two mutually exclusive — and both directions preserve it:

```json
{
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/any_event:0/systolic/_null_flavour|code": "253",
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/any_event:0/systolic/_null_flavour|value": "unknown",
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/any_event:0/systolic/_null_flavour|terminology": "openehr",
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/any_event:0/systolic/_null_reason": "not asked"
}
```

### Who the entry is about: `subject`

Every entry (observation, evaluation, instruction, action, admin entry) records a
subject. It defaults to the owner of the EHR, and while it stays the default it
does not appear on the wire at all. When an entry is about someone else — a
relative, a donor, a fetus — spell it out with the party suffixes:

```json
{
  "family_history/family_history/subject|name": "Susan Doe",
  "family_history/family_history/subject|id": "199",
  "family_history/family_history/subject|id_scheme": "HOSPITAL-NS",
  "family_history/family_history/subject|id_namespace": "HOSPITAL-NS",
  "family_history/family_history/subject/relationship|code": "10",
  "family_history/family_history/subject/relationship|value": "mother",
  "family_history/family_history/subject/relationship|terminology": "openehr"
}
```

A `/relationship` sub-path makes the subject a *related party*; additional
identifiers ride the `/_identifier:n` family; `|_type: "PARTY_SELF"` marks a
subject that is the EHR owner yet still carries an external reference.

### Context fields: `ctx/` shortcut or full path

The composition's event context is normally set through the `ctx/` shortcuts
(`ctx/time`, `ctx/setting`, `ctx/language`, …). The equivalent full paths are
accepted on input too, and take precedence over the shortcut defaults:
`…/context/start_time`, `…/context/setting`, the `_end_time` and `_location`
forms, and an entry's `…/language` and `…/encoding`. A bare
`…/context/setting|code` is resolved against the openEHR *setting* value set,
exactly as `ctx/setting` is. Output always uses the `ctx/` form for these, so a
round trip through FLAT is stable. A path the Simplified Formats specification
does not define is rejected with an error — never silently dropped.

### Embedding canonical JSON with `|raw`

When one node needs full fidelity inside an otherwise-FLAT commit, write the
node's canonical JSON verbatim under the `|raw` suffix:

```json
{
  "vital_signs/blood_pressure/any_event:0/systolic|raw": {
    "_type": "DV_QUANTITY", "magnitude": 120, "unit": "mm[Hg]"
  }
}
```

The embedded object **must** carry `_type` (without it, the key is treated as a
normal leaf). `|raw` is write-only: retrieval always decomposes to regular FLAT
keys.

### Coded text and open value sets

A coded field whose template value set is **open** accepts free text under the
`|other` suffix. `|other` may not be combined with `|code`, `|value`,
`|terminology`, or `|preferred_term` on the same leaf, and is rejected when the
value set is closed.

### Duplicate node names

When a template contains sibling nodes with the same name, the generated
WebTemplate/FLAT path ids are disambiguated with underscore suffixes counted from
1 — `blood_pressure`, `blood_pressure_1`, `blood_pressure_2` — as the
specification prescribes. There is no vendor-compatibility mode: the
specification's numbering is the only numbering, and vendor-only DV_QUANTITY
suffixes such as `|unit_system` and `|unit_display_name` are not accepted. If
your tooling was written against another server's path ids, map them on the
client side.

## Validation on commit

Every composition is validated against its template at commit time — this is
where the template earns its keep. The server checks:

- **structure** — required sections and fields are present, and cardinality and
  occurrence constraints are respected;
- **leaf values** — data types, units, value ranges, string patterns, decimal
  precision, and date/time constraints match the template;
- **terminology** — coded values are members of the value sets the template
  binds, using the bundled openEHR terminology or a configured external FHIR
  terminology server (see [Terminology servers](beyond-core/terminology.md)).

If a composition is well-formed but breaks its template, the commit fails with
**422 Unprocessable Entity** and a `validationErrors` list — one entry per
offending node, as `"<path>: <message>"` — so a client can show the user exactly
what to fix. A syntactically malformed request instead gets **400 Bad Request**.
The error shapes are described in
[Content negotiation & errors](using-the-api/content-negotiation.md#error-responses).

A version committed as `553|incomplete|` relaxes what must be *present* while
still checking everything that is — see the lifecycle notes in
[Resource walkthroughs](using-the-api/resources.md#composition).
